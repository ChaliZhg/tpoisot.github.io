<div class='post-meta'>Written by Tim</div>
<p>I have a terrible confession to make. Two weeks ago, I installed <a href="http://xkcd.com/528/">Windows 7</a>. Nobody was holding me at gunpoint. No member of my family was taken hostage by the IT people which were fed-up by our Mac rebellion. I took the rational, informed decision to install Windows 7 on a brand new machine. Why, oh why, do you ask?</p>

<p>I made the switch from Mac to Linux, that&#39;s why. I needed to install Windows on my new machine before wiping it up and replacing it by Ubuntu (needless to say, I derived a great amount of pleasure in the process). I&#39;m really happy with it. The reason of the switch is quite simple. Over the last months, I&#39;ve been trying to use software that is as simple as possible, but not simpler. No more saying «Cool, I&#39;ve been working with Word for two hours, and it only crashed once!». I&#39;ve progressively moved all my text-editing duties to <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>, including using <a href="https://bitbucket.org/rivanvx/beamer/wiki/Home">beamer</a> for slides and <a href="http://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex">biblatex</a>/<a href="http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a> for bibliography.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also discovered <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pgfplots/">pgfplots</a>, which is <em>incredibly</em> powerful, and is perfectly integrated to LaTeX. Throw in some <a href="http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/">PGF and Tikz</a> for other graphics, and you have yourself a full-featured monster to produce any kind of science you want. While I still use R a lot, I&#39;m progressively moving to <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>, because of the amazing <a href="http://networkx.lanl.gov/">networkx</a> package, which I&#39;ve already mentionned <a href="http://timotheepoisot.fr/2012/05/18/networkx-metapopulations-python/">a few times</a>.</p>

<p>And of course, all of this is kept <a href="http://timotheepoisot.fr/2012/01/06/science-age-social-coding/">updated using git</a>, which I&#39;m lucky to be able to use, thanks to my colleagues being huge nerds. By the way, the people at <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> are really nice, and if you send them an email saying you work in the academia, they&#39;ll give you free private repositories. You can set up a lab account, and be the happiest scientist ever.</p>

<p>The common thread to all of these software is that they&#39;re free. So, I decided that overall, I was better of with a free operating syste, and thus without Mac OS X, which I felt was becoming more of a glorified iPad than a real computing device. In parallel, I used my laptop less and less for simulations, because we have a warbeast of a cluster in the lab, chokefull of CPUs and GPUs, and it was just getting ridiculous waiting two days for simulations that I could run in 5 minutes. So really, I realized that I needed a good machine to write text and produce papers on, with a processor decent enough to do some testing and data-crunching.</p>

<p>And guess what? For half the price of a MacBook air (partly due to my impressive bargaining skills, but still), I found a laptop with everything I needed, <em>including</em> a nvidia GPU which can run <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compute_Unified_Device_Architecture">CUDA</a>. It does everything I want, and working with <a href="http://meldmerge.org/">Meld</a> and <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/">gedit</a> is just great.</p>

<p>But here is an appeal to my fellow geeks. I still miss two things. The first is a PDf annotator. I tried working with <a href="http://xournal.sourceforge.net/">Xournal</a>, which is fun to use, and will probably be even funnier as soon as I will use it with my Wacom tablet, but other people have had issues with reading the annotations. The second thing I miss is Mathematica. I&#39;ll be looking into <a href="http://simpy.sourceforge.net/">simpy</a> in the near future, but it seems to be kind of a hassle. So if you know a good PDF annotator, and a decent platform for symbolic computing (and sadly in my case, a pen and paper is not an option here...), I&#39;d be glad to hear about it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been thinking about making the switch for the last few months (which was somehow facilitated by the fact that I&#39;ve been using Linux sporadically since I discovered <a href="http://knoppix.net/">Knoppix</a> in 2006). Now that it&#39;s done, I couldn&#39;t be happier. Ubuntu is lean, responsive, and uncluttered - in the risk of offedning a lot of people at once, I&#39;d say that the interface is so OS X-like that I immediately felt at home. If you are tempted, you sould defintely try it!</p>
