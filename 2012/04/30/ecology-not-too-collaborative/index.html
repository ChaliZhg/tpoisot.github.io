<p>A few days ago, Jeremy Fox published on the Oikos blog, wondering if <a href="http://oikosjournal.wordpress.com/2012/04/27/is-ecology-becoming-too-collaborative">ecology was becoming too collaborative</a>. The entry received a good number of comments, who mostly dealt with big, long terms collaborations. I can’t really talk for this kind of collaborations, having not been in the business of science for long enough. But I was surprized that small, one shot (or at least, short term) collaborations, were not mentionned. For what it’s worth, here is my contribution to the debate. I’m involved in a few short term collaborations, and I think they are awesome.</p>

<p>One of the ideas behind <a href="http://innge.net/">INNGE</a> was that ecology will require more and more global approaches in the next decade, which will require to use more and more diverse tools. While I love learning new stuff and methods, there are only 24 hours in a day, and it’s sometimes good to go look for a particular skill. This can be the basis of a short collaboration — you know how to do <em>x</em>, I want <em>x</em> done on my data, let’s do it together. The really good thing if you operate with this logic is that you will increase the limit of what you can do, or what you can tell about your data.</p>

<p>Perhaps it won’t be better science, but it will be more complete science, in that the problem will be looked at at different angles. This complementarity is something extremely valuable, and by relying only on a small set of collaborators for an extended period of time, I’d fear loosing it, and missing on some great opportunities. Then again, these collaborations are different from a size project. It’s more about finding someone with the necessary skills to complete your project, then working together (writing it, I realize it may be a side project <em>for the other person</em>). And these people come with a different viewpoint, ideas, litterature they master, on so forth.</p>

<p>In short, any collaboration offer you the opportunity to do things which are just too big or to cross-disciplinary to do by yourself. It may be time consuming, but it’s probably worth it.</p>
