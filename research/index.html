	<p>I have an unhealthy obsession with species interaction networks, their structure, their dynamics, and the causes and consequences thereof. I'm even happier when I manage to frame my questions in the context of biogeography or coevolution.</p>

<h1>Biogeography of species interaction networks</h1>

<p>So far, our view of interaction networks, <em>i.e.</em> the interaction between species, was very <em>static</em>. Sure, there are changes in biomass, but the interactions between species stay relatively similar. And most notably, if you know that two species interact at one place, you can safely assume that they will interact elsewhere. But is that so? I focus on (i) trying to understand <em>why</em> networks can vary through space and time, and (ii) <em>how predictible</em> this variation is. Ultimately, because this will force us to understand why two populations interact, I expect that this work will also help <em>predicting</em> species interactions.</p>

<h1>The consequences of network structure</h1>

<p><img src="/images/network-prop.png" class="pull-right" />One of my research goal is to understand the consequences of network structure (and of its variability) on ecosystem properties (mostly related to functioning), and on evolutionary dynamics. This is mostly done through analysis and simulations of simple models, although I work with microbial communities of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarracenia_purpurea">purple pitcher plant <em>Sarracenia purpurea</em></a> as well. I'm interested in the idea that the structure of network can be selected (through ecological or evolutionary pressure) to maximize useful emerging properties.</p>

<h1>Specialization in coevolving communities</h1>

<p>Why do species invest so much energy into so few activities? Is it true that specialists are better than generalists? Can't you be a master of all if you're a Jack of all trades? I spent my PhD working on these questions in coevolving communities. Notably, we managed to show that the drivers of specialization in <em>biotic</em> and <em>abiotic</em> environments are the same, and are not that complicated either!</p>

<h1>Microbes and ecology</h1>

<p>Ecologists are not always doing cool things in the field (I'm actually never in the field, at all). It sometimes pays to put on a lab coat, and go play with microbes. I enjoy working on microbial systems because they evolve fast, grow fast, and doesn't smell that bad once you get used to them. And if it gives me a chance to compare the ecological mechanisms acting in microbial and non-microbial communities, that's a really cool bonus!</p>

<h1>Open science</h1>

<p>Not really a research question, but I try to do my part in opening-up science. I think that we need more than just open access: sharing of data, and code, should become mandatory. We also try to motivate people using new tools, and raise the awareness of preprints servers and how they can help us. I mostly discuss these topics <a href="#next-gen%20science-ref">here on my blog</a>, but I have a few papers coming up on the subject.</p>
