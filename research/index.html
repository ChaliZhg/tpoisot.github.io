<h2>Spatial ecology of species interactions</h2>
</div>
   </div>
</div>

<div class="row content">
   <div class="large-12 columns">
   <p>I am working at the interfaces between (evolutionary) community ecology and
biogegraphy, and using network analysis to adress broad questions in these
disciplines.</p>

<h1>Spatial ecology of species interactions</h1>

<p>So far, our view of interaction networks, <em>i.e.</em> the interaction
between species, was very <em>static</em>. Sure, there are changes in
biomass, but the interactions between species stay relatively
similar. And most notably, if you know that two species interact at one
place, you can safely assume that they will interact elsewhere. But is
that so? I focus on (i) trying to understand <em>why</em> networks can vary
through space and time, and (ii) <em>how predictible</em> this variation is.
Ultimately, because this will force us to understand why two
populations interact, I expect that this work will also help
<em>predicting</em> species interactions.</p>

<h1>Predicting species interactions</h1>

<p>Predicting interactions between species will be increasingly important, given
that large-scale environmental changes will result in the emergence of novel
communities. I develop statistical approaches to integrate various mechanisms
(related to species local abundances, local trait distributions, phylogenetic
history), to derive a <em>local probability</em> that species will interact. Doing so
also requires to understand the mechanisms of species interactions, and will
give better insights on the variation of species interactions.</p>

<h1>The consequences of network structure</h1>

<p><img src="/images/network-prop.png" class="pull-right" />One of my research
goal is to understand the consequences of network structure (and of its
variability) on ecosystem properties (mostly related to functioning), and
on evolutionary dynamics. This is mostly done through analysis and simulations
of simple models, although I work with microbial communities of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarracenia_purpurea">purple
pitcher plant <em>Sarracenia
purpurea</em></a> as well. I'm
interested in the idea that the structure of network can be selected (through
ecological or evolutionary pressure) to maximize useful emerging
properties. Through collaborations, I work on the relationships between
epidemic spread and the structure of ecological networks. In the long term,
a better knowledge of the relationships between ecological network
structure and disease spread will result in more informed public
health strategies.</p>

<h1>Microbes and ecology</h1>

<p>Ecologists are not always doing cool things in the field (I'm actually never in
the field, at all). It sometimes pays to put on a lab coat, and go play
with microbes. I enjoy working on microbial systems because they evolve fast,
grow fast, and doesn't smell that bad once you get used to them. I use
short term experiments or experimental evolution designs to test
hypotheses developed in different research  areas. And if it gives me
a chance to compare the ecological mechanisms acting in microbial and
non-microbial communities, that's a really cool bonus!</p>

<h1>Open ecology</h1>

<p>The paradox that ecology produces so many data, and require so many data, yet
has no proper tradition of efficient and open data sharing never ceases to
amaze me. I advocate data sharing, the use of preprints, and more broadly, the
use of the rich ecosystem of open-science applications and software in
ecological research. Although some of this advocacy resulted in publications,
this topic is mostly discussed in my blog.</p>
