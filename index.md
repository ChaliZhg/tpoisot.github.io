I’m Timothée Poisot, a post-doctoral researcher in the lab of Dominique Gravel at the Université du Québec à Rimouski. I work on the biogeography of complex food webs using a natural system of pitcher plants, theoretical models, and computer simulations. I’m interested in how the complexity of food webs emerges from simple ecological and evolutionary mechanisms, and how our view of species interaction changes in a spatial context. My current research project is focused on the relationships between the structure of trophic interactions and ecosystem functioning.

I obtained my PhD at the Université Montpellier 2, in the group of Evolutionary Community Ecology. I focused on the evolution of ecological specialization in coevolving systems, especially in the context of antagonistic coevolution (hosts and parasites, predators and preys, …). I looked at the consequences of specialization on the structure of interacting communities, and how environmental factors can regulate the mechanisms (and patterns) of specialization. My approach used equal parts of experimental work using natural isolates of bacteria (Pseudomonas fluorescens) and lytic bacteriophages, and theoretical work using computer simulations and model analysis.

When I’m not doing science, I’m talking about science (and encouraging other to do so) with Plume!, a scientific vulgarization network like you’ve never seen before. I’m also involved in the International Network of Next-Generation Ecologists, and the French Ecological Society, to help ecologists reach out to the public, and get involved in discussions about global changes and other relevant issues. I also try to make most of my code Open Source, so checkout my code portfolio hosted at GitHub.
