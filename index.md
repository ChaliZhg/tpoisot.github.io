I'm a community ecologist interested in the evolution of species interactions.

I’m currently a post-doctoral researcher in [the lab of Dominique Gravel](http://chaire-eec.uqar.qc.ca/dom-fr.php) at the Université du Québec à Rimouski. I work on the biogeography of complex food webs using a natural system of pitcher plants, theoretical models, and computer simulations. I’m interested in how the complexity of food webs emerges from simple ecological and evolutionary mechanisms, and how our view of species interaction changes in a spatial context. My current research project is focused on the relationships between the structure of trophic interactions and ecosystem functioning.

1. **Food webs in space** — Why do species interaction vary through space, and what are the environmental drivers of these variations? These questions are investigated using a mixture of field sampling, simulations, and data analysis. I am also developping new methodologies to help quantifying variation.
2. **Network biodiversity and ecosystem functioning** — How does the structure of species interaction relates to ecosystem functioning? We work with a simple theoretical model, whose predictions are tested with a microbial system of bacteria and phages.
3. **High-throughput molecular ecology** — In addition to using high-throughput targeted tag sequencing for some projects, we are engaged in a reflexion about how these methods can be used at their full potential in community ecology.
4. **Networks, networks, and some more networks** — I'm generally interested by the causes and consequences of species interactions network structure on different community and ecosystem properties, through a few collaborations.

Before that, I obtained my PhD at the Université Montpellier 2, in the group of [Evolutionary Community Ecology](http://www.eec.univ-montp2.fr/). I focused on the evolution of ecological specialization in coevolving systems, especially in the context of antagonistic coevolution (hosts and parasites, predators and preys, …). I looked at the consequences of specialization on the structure of interacting communities, and how environmental factors can regulate the mechanisms (and patterns) of specialization. My approach used equal parts of experimental work using natural isolates of bacteria (*Pseudomonas fluorescens*) and lytic bacteriophages, and theoretical work using computer simulations and model analysis.

When I’m not doing science, I’m talking about science (and encouraging other to do so) with [Plume!](http://www.plume.info/), a scientific vulgarization network like you’ve never seen before. I’m also involved in the [International Network of Next-Generation Ecologists](http://www.innge.net/), and the [French Ecological Society](http://www.sfecologie.org/), to help ecologists reach out to the public, and get involved in discussions about global changes and other relevant issues.
