##Analyzing bipartite networks in Python
[bipy](http://tpoisot.github.com/bipy/) is a Python module to analyse bipartite ecological networks, integrated with [NetworkX](http://networkx.lanl.gov/)
	
##Phylogenetic tree classes</h2>
[PyCoPhy](https://github.com/tpoisot/PyCoPhy) is a set of Python classes to keep track of, and manipulate, very basic phylogenetic trees, with built-in Newick export. It's designed to be easy to embed in other simulations.

##Measuring Ecological Specificity</h2>
[ESM](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/esm/) is a R package to measure ecological specialization at the species level. Most of its functions are included in bipy.
