<p>The interesting thing about predictions is that sometimes, they come true. Last
week, I was discussing the need to do advocacy about open data; specifically,
the need to do it fast, because one day, a big journal will release a new
policy, and we are going to see the closest thing to mass hysteria that the
academic world can do. If I was so good at predicting species interactions,
I&#39;d be a much happier ecologist.</p>

<p><em>PLoS</em> journals <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2014/02/24/plos-new-data-policy-public-access-data/">announced a new data release policy</a>, which is now
effective. People <a href="http://rxnm.wordpress.com/2014/02/25/fan-fiction/">freaked out</a>. Some effectively stated that data sharing encourages scientific <a href="http://smallpondscience.com/2014/03/03/i-own-my-data-until-i-dont/">freeloading</a>, and I only link to the later because there is an interesting point made in the comments:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I suspect that you’re fully aware that the sharing of R programming has
some fundamental differences with the sharing of original scientific data. The
existence of R itself is a medium for community sharing. It’s like the NEON
or LTER but for data analysis, designed as a public resource. I didn’t design
my experiments for their data to be a public resource, except for the findings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See, that&#39;s where I lost it. I&#39;m a methods developer. Some of my papers
I like the most are built on the idea of finding the best way to measure
something, or comparing and understanding different measures, and wrapping
things up in a <code>R</code> package or <code>python</code> script, which are made public, and
that I spend an insane amount of time troubleshooting through email because
I care about enabling people to use what I do. Yet in two sentences, my work
is robbed of all its meaning because, well, of course it ought to be public,
it&#39;s public service and people developing methods only do so to serve people
generating data.</p>

<p><strong>I agree with that</strong>. The most enjoyable thing for me is to face an empirical
problem that reveals a gap in our methodology, and then filling a notepad
with sketches and equations until I come up with a new way of measuring old
things. And I&#39;m an ecologist. My interest is in understanding ecological
systems, and I choose to do so with a heavy component of methodological
development. I&#39;m glad when people show interest in what I&#39;ve done, which
is why I spend time replying to emails on technical questions, writing code
for people, and trying to understand why things behave the way they do.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what I don&#39;t agree with: the sense of entitlement. The above excerpt
(and most of the post it comes from) is, I think, the opinion of a minority,
but it should be vocally opposed nonetheless. I don&#39;t believe I am entitled
to other peoples&#39; data. I don&#39;t know anyone who does. Yet some people feel
that they are entitled to new methods, because there are apparently on one
side nerds with glasses and computers (I plead guilty), and on the other
side &quot;real&quot; ecologists with muddy boots and field trips. And saying that
methods are supposed to be given away for free, while data should be released
whenever you damn well please send a very clear message about which side is
the best one, about which side is privileged. So I don&#39;t take lightly to my
work being belittled as community service, because I would never say that
all empiricists are good for is taking data for me to develop new methods with.</p>

<p>Not only is that attitude counterproductive, it&#39;s re-inforcing the
divide between theory and empiricism in biology at large, and ecology
in particular. I think it&#39;s high time that we recognize that datasets,
methods, ideas, and what have you, are all ingredients in a research
paper. Initiatives like <em>ImpactStory</em> are helping in that direction. I&#39;m
convinced that dialogue between everyone, and meaningful collaborations
between theoretical and empirical scientists are the way to go, and will
produce better science. Ultimately, it will also help each of these aspects
of doing research being recognized, as I discussed in my talk at the <a href="http://figshare.com/articles/Open_science_Make_your_work_known_/877095">QCBS
panel on open ecology</a>.</p>

<p>So in short: <strong>research would gain to be open</strong>. I want to believe that no one
is out there to <em>steal</em> the work of others. Re-use is probably the highest form
of recognition you can get, because it means that what you have <em>done</em> (not
what you have written about it) allowed other people to build something new. And we&#39;re all doing different things, but also complementary things. As ecologists, we <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.910101.x/abstract">ought to know that it should be beneficial for productivity</a>...</p>
