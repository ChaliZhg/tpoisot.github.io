      <p>The interesting thing about predictions is that sometimes, they come true. Last week, I was discussing the need to do advocacy about open data; specifically, the need to do it fast, because one day, a big journal will release a new policy, and we are going to see the closest thing to mass hysteria that the academic world can do. If I was so good at predicting species interactions, I’d be a much happier ecologist.</p>
<p><em>PLoS</em> journals <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2014/02/24/plos-new-data-policy-public-access-data/">announced a new data release policy</a>, which is now effective. People <a href="http://rxnm.wordpress.com/2014/02/25/fan-fiction/">freaked out</a>. Some effectively stated that data sharing encourages scientific <a href="http://smallpondscience.com/2014/03/03/i-own-my-data-until-i-dont/">freeloading</a>, and I only link to the later because there is an interesting point made in the comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I suspect that you’re fully aware that the sharing of R programming has some fundamental differences with the sharing of original scientific data. The existence of R itself is a medium for community sharing. It’s like the NEON or LTER but for data analysis, designed as a public resource. I didn’t design my experiments for their data to be a public resource, except for the findings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See, that’s where I lost it. I’m a methods developer. Some of my papers I like the most are built on the idea of finding the best way to measure something, or comparing and understanding different measures, and wrapping things up in a <code>R</code> package or <code>python</code> script, which are made public, and that I spend an insane amount of time troubleshooting through email because I care about enabling people to use what I do. Yet in two sentences, my work is robbed of all its meaning because, well, of course it ought to be public, it’s public service and people developing methods only do so to serve people generating data.</p>
<p><strong>I agree with that</strong>. The most enjoyable thing for me is to face an empirical problem that reveals a gap in our methodology, and then filling a notepad with sketches and equations until I come up with a new way of measuring old things. And I’m an ecologist. My interest is in understanding ecological systems, and I choose to do so with a heavy component of methodological development. I’m glad when people show interest in what I’ve done, which is why I spend time replying to emails on technical questions, writing code for people, and trying to understand why things behave the way they do.</p>
<p>Here’s what I don’t agree with: the sense of entitlement. The above excerpt (and most of the post it comes from) is, I think, the opinion of a minority, but it should be vocally opposed nonetheless. I don’t believe I am entitled to other peoples’ data. I don’t know anyone who does. Yet some people feel that they are entitled to new methods, because there are apparently on one side nerds with glasses and computers (I plead guilty), and on the other side “real” ecologists with muddy boots and field trips. And saying that methods are supposed to be given away for free, while data should be released whenever you damn well please send a very clear message about which side is the best one, about which side is privileged. So I don’t take lightly to my work being belittled as community service, because I would never say that all empiricists are good for is taking data for me to develop new methods with.</p>
<p>Not only is that attitude counterproductive, it’s re-inforcing the divide between theory and empiricism in biology at large, and ecology in particular. I think it’s high time that we recognize that datasets, methods, ideas, and what have you, are all ingredients in a research paper. Initiatives like <em>ImpactStory</em> are helping in that direction. I’m convinced that dialogue between everyone, and meaningful collaborations between theoretical and empirical scientists are the way to go, and will produce better science. Ultimately, it will also help each of these aspects of doing research being recognized, as I discussed in my talk at the <a href="http://figshare.com/articles/Open_science_Make_your_work_known_/877095">QCBS panel on open ecology</a>.</p>
<p>So in short: <strong>research would gain to be open</strong>. I want to believe that no one is out there to <em>steal</em> the work of others. Re-use is probably the highest form of recognition you can get, because it means that what you have <em>done</em> (not what you have written about it) allowed other people to build something new. And we’re all doing different things, but also complementary things. As ecologists, we <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.910101.x/abstract">ought to know that it should be beneficial for productivity</a>…</p>
