<div class='post-meta'>Written by Tim</div>
<p>I have been doing a bunch of reading on software licenses, because the
question of which one to pick popped up in two projects I currently work
on. There are tools like GitHub&#39;s <em><a href="http://choosealicense.com/">choose a license</a></em>, that compare a
fairly good selection of FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) licenses. And
you can find a lot of (good) advice around the internet that will advise
you to pick a license for your code. See <em>e.g.</em> <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/resources/guides/choosing-open-source-licence">sofwtare.ac.uk</a>,
a paper by <a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002598">Andrew Morin and colleagues</a>, and more <a href="http://www.astrobetter.com/the-whys-and-hows-of-licensing-scientific-code/">tutorial like
documents</a>. If you read all of that (and if you produce code,
I think you should), you&#39;ll most likely agree that licensing your work
is important.</p>

<p>Yet <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/crapl/">as Matt Might points out</a>, FOSS licenses tailored specifically for
academic use should have other requirements besides no liability and ensuring
sharing of modified code. I spend a sometimes significant amount of my time
writing code to perform various analyzes, or to reproduce results. I think that
this is a research output equally important to publishing the paper (in that
I see very little value in a great methodological paper with no code attached,
for starters); which means that I think it should be credited somehow.</p>

<p>One thing I have noticed in various discussions over the last few months is
that the fact that (good) software is hard to produce completely eludes some
people. This is perfectly understandable. In part, because we (as computer
users) are <a href="http://linux.oneandoneis2.org/LNW.htm">demanding software working intuitively out of the box</a>. As a
result, most mainstream operating systems (and I&#39;m including several Linux
distributions in that) are focusing on <em>user-friendliness</em>, so that even
complex things <em>appear</em> really simple. Given that, really, how hard can
programming a <code>R</code> package that doesn&#39;t even have a GUI be? Software is a
given right, and (I have checked some of my papers and I must plead guilty
to that too) citing some of the software that made a paper possible is still
not automatic. And to really drive the point home: if someone publishes
a paper using package <code>xyz</code>, without citing the paper describing <code>xyz</code>
(or the software itself should there be no paper to cite), that person get
credit while the software creator does not.</p>

<p>Even the very concept of a software license is focused on people with some
computing experience. It tells things about the use of the code, in the
sense that it tells you whether you can make money with it (not with the
output), whether you can modify the code, and if so, which future licenses
are acceptable. In short, the licensing issue is definitely an important
one in science, but it does not speaks to the end users. Now before you
preemptively burn be at the stake before I propose <a href="http://xkcd.com/501/">EULAs</a> for all
scientific software, hear me out. On a daily basis, what you do with my code
matters to me far less than whether I get credit for having produced the code
in the first place, especially when this code is actually used. I would be
happy to release 90% of everything I write using the <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net/about/">WTFPL</a> (just
to see if I can managed to spell it out in a paper, mostly). So I think we
need <em>some sort</em> of license between the creator of the software and the users.</p>

<p>An additional complication (or nuance, rather) is that thanks to increased
computer literacy, a lot of people will be able to either add to, or modify
your software for their own needs. In a sense, software users will contribute
to the improvement of it, <em>as long as they give back</em> their modifications. It
may not seem like a lot, but a function to read and convert a specific
type of file to use with a particular package <em>is</em> a potentially worthwhile
addition to it. In this hypothetical scenario, if the &quot;new&quot; format is used
by a lot of people in the field, then this can even improve the adoption
of the software. So where to go from here? An ideal license for scientific
software would (i) ensure that the creator gets credit for its work, (ii)
facilitates the improvement of the software through community contributions,
and (iii) build on existing FOSS licenses.</p>

<p>I think the modular design of the <em>Creative Commons</em> licenses is a good
inspiration. Basically, we could write an OSSL (Open Scientific Software
License) with the four following clauses (purely as an intellectual
exercise). Each people would then be free to use any combination (or all)
of the clauses in their particular releases. Ideally, the software would be
released under two different licenses. One of the mainstream FOSS ones for
general code re-use, and the OSSL for use in research.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">Open Scientific Software License (OSSL) 0.0.1

This document presents the conditions for the use of, and contribution to,
"XXXX", hereafter "the software", by you, hereafter "the user".

[insert usual warning about no liability]

(AU) AUTHORSHIP -- Developpers of the software do not make any claim to
authorship on projects using the software unless

   (1) explicitely invited by the user
   (2) the user requests the software to be altered in any significant
       way for the purpose of a project, in which case authorship for this
       particular project must be negociated between the user and the creator

(CR) CREDIT -- Any scientific production appearing in print (excluding posters
and talks, including electronic only content) using the software must cite
the following item[s]:

   Ref. to the paper or the software itself
   You are expected to keep it relatively short

(DI) DISTRIBUTION -- Outside of academic/research projects, this code is
dual-licensed under the terms XXX license, a copy of which is attached to
this project under the COPYING file.

(EN) ENHANCEMENT -- If the software is modified, expanded, or improved during
the realisation of a study, the person in charge of the modifications is
required to propose them for merging when the results obtained with the
modified software are first published, or earlier.
</code></pre></div>
<p>If you use code released under the <code>OSSL/AU-CR</code>, for example, you can use
the code and modify it without proposing your modifications for merging,
and your only requirement is to cite it. The <code>AU</code> clause is (in my opinion)
important because it makes the conditions for authorship clear: if you
don&#39;t interact in any way with the software creator, then (of course) he or
she should not be asking for authorship. But if you ask whether or not the
creator could introduce a new functionality, or alter the functioning of the
program in any way, then it&#39;s fair to discuss whether or not this qualifies for
authorship (I argue that it does; I&#39;ve had a very good experience recently of
inviting a co-author to help us figure out his package, and he made excellent
contributions to the paper).</p>

<p>So in short (that was not short at all!), this is the current state of my
thinking about finding a way to license (open) scientific software that would
respect the right of software creators to get credit for their work. Whether
or not I&#39;ll add this as a license for my own projects is something I have
not decided yet. That will depend in part of the feedback I get...</p>
