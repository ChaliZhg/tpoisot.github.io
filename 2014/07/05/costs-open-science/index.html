            <span class="content">
               <p>Over the last year, I have had <em>a lot</em> of discussions about upsides, downsides, and other directionless-sides (assuming there are such things) of open science. I talked about the upsides many times (and I will keep on doing it), but it would not be really honest not to mention the potential disadvantages and risks of adopting new practices: publishing in new journals, using preprints in a field where it is not the norm, open peer-review, publishing raw datasets, … So, roll yourself in your favorite blanket, and brace yourself for the impending wave of negativity (also a <em>Jurassic Park</em> quote somewhere to keep you on the edge).</p>
<p>Most of the risks come from the fact that these practices are, to a certain extent, <em>new</em>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and science is historically well attached to its “rules and standards” <span class="citation" data-cites="kuh70">(Kuhn 1970 chap. 2)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because [the new scientist] there joins men who learned the bases of their field from the same concrete models, his subsequent practice will seldom evoke overt disagreement over fundamentals. <strong>Men whose research is based on shared paradigms are committed to the same rules and standards for scientific practice</strong>. That commitment and the apparent consensus it produces are prerequisites for normal science, <em>i.e.</em>, for the genesis and continuation of a particular research tradition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keeping the same core of (currently) common practices, in this perspective, is a matter of self-preservation (and it is amusing to note that in Kuhn’s view, at least as it is expressed in this paragraph, there is little chance that <em>established</em> scientists will be the source of change – my own observations don’t support that, but this is 45 years after this paragraph was written). Deviation from these practices carries a two-fold risk of either excluding yourself from the boy’s club (I’m most likely reading too much into it, but I always found Kuhn’s use of <em>men</em> instead of <em>scientists</em> meaningful), or being viewed as opposed to the “continuation” of your field.</p>
<p>Falling exactly in line with this argument, most of the objections to open science that I have received, were about the need to preserve either oneself or the field as a whole. Preprints are bad because they will facilitate the spread of (and legitimate) bad or biased science. Open reviews are bad because people will hold grudges against you. Publishing in new journals is bad because – whether we like it or not – the journals you publish in are still used as a measure of your worth, and the name of a journal is most likely a “green-beard trait”.</p>
<p>All of these potential costs are real (although I think that the benefits, both collective and individuals, far outweigh them), and so it should be expected that open science would hurt early-career scientists the most. This attitude is exemplified by the recent decision of <em>Ecology Letters</em> not to allow preprinted papers to be submitted <a href="http://jabberwocky.weecology.org/2014/06/30/why-the-ecology-letters-editorial-board-should-reconsider-its-no-vote-on-preprints-2/">so as to protect early career people from themselves</a> (although they should be given credit for at least discussing the situation). Yet as far as I can tell, the opposite is happening: those of us with supposedly the most to lose are also spending the most time and energy experimenting, advocating, and generally having tons of fun trying to make ourselves at home.</p>
<p>And this is a side of the discussion that is (I think) often overlooked. It’s about settling into a new home, and shuffling the furniture around a bit to see if we can make it more to our liking. It’s not about tearing down the house to build a hippie commune. And it’s certainly not about shifting the system towards practices that would allow us to be sloppy and generally unprofessional. Most of the calls for openness in science are emphasizing accountability and transparency; I really am convinced that in an entirely open system, it is virtually impossible to cut corners (tho in the immortal words of Dr. Ian Malcolm, “Life finds a way”). In short, deciding whether or not it’s worth bearing whatever (real of perceived) costs of open science is worth it is about deciding whether or not we trust that the system is currently at its global optimum, and whether or not less seasoned scientists also have a saying in shaping the system they will practice their science in.</p>
<p>Marie Curie is quoted as saying “Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood; now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.”. This captures my feelings about all of the above particularly well. I think it’s important not to overlook the fact that some of the people the most able to bear the “costs” of these practices are also (sometimes) opposed to them for fear of said costs. But without seriously considering these practices, that is by not seeing them as marginal anymore, it’s difficult to say whether or not these costs exist at all, and whether they will erode over time because we will also better understand and measure the benefits.</p>
<p>I would hate that you think that I am reducing the issue to a generation-gap thing, which I don’t believe it is. But it’s true that those of us with less reputation attached to our name should be the most fearful of any new practice that would supposedly attract any cost, because it would hit us proportionally harder than it would hit someone with a number of publications in the triple digits. Nor am I expecting that everything will change overnight. But without being really engaged in some experimentation, I don’t think we will ever be able to correctly assess the costs and the benefits.</p>
<p>As a final note – I could write a text twice as long about all of the good things that happened to me as a consequence of being open. I’ve heard the argument that some of the costs may be expressed years after the fact. I really don’t think this is a particularity of either the new or old ways of doing things. And I understand that all of us have different experiences. But from what I have heard of people trying new things, the result was “mostly good”.</p>
