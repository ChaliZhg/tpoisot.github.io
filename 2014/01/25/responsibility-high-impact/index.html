<div class='post-title'><a class="readmore" href="/2014/01/25/responsibility-high-impact/">Responsibility and sensationalism in high-profile papers</a></div>
<p>Last week, we had an inter-lab journal club during which we discussed a very polemic paper in ecology. The discussion quickly turned into the responsibility of people at the various levels of the scientific publishing process, and the risks associated with counter-mainstream results appearing in high-profile journals. Most of what follows is my recollection of the different arguments we raised for and against self-censorship in scientific publishing. Which paper we discussed is not relevant for the rest of this post, so I’ll try to summarize the issue in extremely broad terms. There is a well-known relationship between concept <em>B</em> and property <em>C</em>. Changes in <em>B</em> are expected, under some circumstances, to result in changes in <em>C</em>. <em>B</em> is a complex thing with several layers to it. A set of studies showed no variation of <em>A</em>, which is a component of <em>B</em>, and so it seems to question the relationship between <em>B</em> and <em>C</em>.</p>
<p>For different reasons, whether there is (i) a change in <em>A</em>, and (ii) a link between <em>B</em> and <em>C</em>, is a pretty big deal when it comes to policy making. “Proving” that the relationship is not general, or not important, or even wrong, is susceptible to have real-world consequences. In addition, it would be a big deal for theoretical science as well, because it will mean that what we thought (and still think) of an important concept in ecology, is wrong and need to be re-built. But it would also mean that, as far as policy makers are concerned, we can persist in several “business as usual” practices; after all, there are now data to back them up!</p>
<p>So, should we practice self-censorship? Absolutely not. The “cost” of making all information public has been particularly discussed in the context of bio-terrorism; understanding the risks requires results to be published, but publishing results can increase <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK98397/">the ease to produce bioweapons</a>. Some argue that <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1353/hcr.2007.0046/abstract">not all results should be published</a>, but determining which should, and which should not, is a tricky issue. Some ecological results have very strong relevance for policy-making (and lobbies), and there is a risk that some will have a political reading of some papers.</p>
<p>The question is, therefore, who is responsible for “customer service”<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> once a new result appears? First thing first, the authors. I have the feeling that a perverse effect of the publish-or-perish mentality is a quest for sensationalism (which seems to be confirmed by this <a href="http://nsaunders.wordpress.com/2013/07/16/interestingly-the-sentence-adverbs-of-pubmed-central/">analysis of adverbs used in PMC papers</a>, where more abstracts emphasize interest, surprise, and novelty). And when we (scientists) read a paper making bold claims, we are able to rationalize them because it’s not the first paper we are reading. We are able to weigh one result against dozens of others. But my very personal and humble opinion is that, when the result we report is likely to make a splash, we have to consider whether the way we express it is likely to be mistaken by the public.</p>
<p>Second, editors have a role to play. There is a well documented relationship between <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2011/08/11/is-it-time-for-a-retraction-index/">impact factor and likelihood of retractation</a>, and a tendency for the media to cover <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0085355">not the best conducted studies</a> (perhaps, has we hypothesized, because most science is normal, and normal science is very rarely cool for people outside the field). It would make sense that the boxes with comments from the editor, that seem to appear in more and more journals, be dedicated to putting sensational papers into the broader context.</p>
<p>And finally, science journalists. One of the things that never fails to amaze/annoy me is that, when a vastly mediatised paper ends up being retracted, there is almost never any indication of that in the media (our short attention span be damned). Which means that unless you specifically follow people discussing the issue, do you know that bacteria are still unable to use arsenic in their DNA? I get that saying “Nope, turned out we were pretty much right about how life works” is unlikely to make the headlines (unless you want to, you know, <em>inform</em>). As this post <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2009/07/04/does-science-journalism-falter-or-flourish-under-embargo/">really clearly states</a>, the ability to react <em>right now</em> on a big story is important for the career of journalists. It lead to (in my mind) absurd situations in which journalists can prepare their copy before the majority of the scientific community knows the results.</p>
<p>As a final note, I have nothing against sensationalism. If anything (if it is backed by facts and sound interpretation), sensational ideas and results are a great way to make people interested in science. Telling a story about the population dynamics of an emblematic animal makes for better communication than the subtleties of a stochastic, spatially explicit generalized Lotka-Volterra model (somehow). But everything even remotely close to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-normal_science">post-normal science</a> should be written carefully, contextualized carefully, and reported on carefully.</p>
