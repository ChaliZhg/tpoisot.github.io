<p>Literally one of the first things I told my students in the first lecture of
the <em>Population and Community Dynamics</em> class I gave last winter was along the
lines of <em>an ecological community is the pool of all species occuring at the
same place and at the same time (and the interactions between them)</em>. This is
more or a less a synthesis of what you can find in the first pages of Peter
Morin’s textbook, for example; and so far, I was relatively satisfied by this
definition.
<span class="margin">Leaper <em>et al.</em> (2014) <em>Ecology</em> <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/13-0789.1">DOI</a> </span>
Then a few weeks ago, I read the Leaper <em>et al.</em> paper in <em>Ecology</em>, which
uses co-occurrence data from marine species to question the “classical”
definition of a community. Their most important finding is that, when
clustering species in a large spatial dataset, there are groups of highly
correlated species. The interesting thing is that these groups are not unique
to any particular location, and are not necessarily found together. Or in
short, “communities” are a mix between the two definitions of “whatever is
found locally” and “the most characteristic species of an assemblage”.</p>

<p>As I was writing this post, <a href="http://evol-eco.blogspot.ca/2014/01/a-multiplicity-of-communities-for.html">Caroline Tucker</a> wrote a very interesting
piece on the <em>multiplicity of ecological communities</em>. Which you should read,
because it covers a lot of the ground I was planning on covering (and I had to
delete a few paragraphs). Let’s just say I am glad that the first time I get
scooped is for a blog post and not for a paper. So just go read Caroline’s
piece, but then come back, because I will try to put another twist on the
subject. Specifically, should we adapt our message when teaching?</p>

<p>The end of Caroline’s piece is that we should not try to have a
one-size-fits-none definition of what an ecological community is. I thought
it was the only significant weakness of Mark Vellend’s otherwise excellent
synthesis from a few years ago: a definition of a community which is as
simple as the one I gave in the introduction of this post.
<span class="margin"> Vellend (2010) <em>Quart Rev Biol</em> <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20565040">PubMed</a></span>
Defining communities this way has one distinct advantage: it is straightforward
to go from community to meta-communities (<em>a bunch of communities connected
by the dispersal of at least one of their species</em>). But the important point
is that the world is most likely not discrete, and the elegant framework of
meta-everything is probably not going to hold in its entirety in continuous
landscapes.</p>

<p>So looking back, I am thinking that the nice tale we are telling students is
(i) probably not relevant at the local scale, because it considers that the
qaudrat we work on is a perfectly isolated island, and (ii) probably not
relevant at the regional scale either, because it does not expands nicely to
a continuous spatial context. What should we tell then? I think it would be
an interesting discussion, to present the “simple” definition of a community
to students, and get them to understand when it breaks. How do you define the
area you consider to define a community? What if the environment is always
moving (like lagoons, intertidal zones, …)? What if you started walking,
from your sampling point, in the same direction; when do you leave the zone
“defined” by your community?</p>

<p>Another interesting approach would be to compare this definition to classical
large scale experimental systems. Looking at the list of the <em>greatest</em>
ecological experiments proposed by <a href="http://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2014/01/13/whats-the-greatest-ecology-experiment-in-history/">Jeremy Fox and in the comments</a>,
or just showing pictures of Huffaker’s oranges, or the Adirondack lakes, on
any microcosm setup, should lead to the realization that most of these systems
conform to the discrete theory (counterpoint: <em>Barro Colorado Island</em>). Coming
back to the paper by Leaper <em>et al.</em>, it is actually hardly surprising that
marine biologists are once more pushing the ideas that discrete communities
may make very little sense: dispersion is cheap and easy in the oceans, and for
some functional groups, it is entirely passive (McManus &amp; Woodson propose nice
evidence that this mode of dispersal will “assemble” consistent communities).
<span class="margin">McManus &amp; Woodson (2012) <em>J Exp Biol</em> <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22357594">PubMed</a></span>
In short, there is a tremendous opportunity to engage with students on the
relationship between <em>what</em> we study, <em>how</em> we study it, and how it can
<em>shape</em> the theoretical background we develop to make sense of observations.</p>
