<div class='post-meta'>Written by Tim</div>
<p>On January 5, I will start a position as an assistant professor at the
<a href="http://en.bio.umontreal.ca/home/">Department of Biological Sciences, Université de Montréal</a>. So spoiler
alert, this story has a happy ending. Looking for a job has been an incredibly
formative experience, and I wanted to share some of it with you.</p>

<p><em>This is part 1 out of 4 of a series of posts in which I summarize my
year and a half spent looking for, and ultimately getting, an academic
position. I will try to publish one every two weeks. It is mostly intended
as an excuse to look back at what happened, and hopefully hear about your
experiences too. Simon Goring explained the <a href="http://downwithtime.wordpress.com/2014/04/08/the-job-hunt-in-france/">application  process</a>
and his <a href="http://downwithtime.wordpress.com/2014/04/08/the-job-search-in-france-part-ii/">overall feeling</a> in a way that matches what I&#39;m about to
say, and you should read his perspective too; you will  see that we had the
same feeling about the interview, in particular.</em></p>

<p>When I started my first post-doc in November 2011, I decided to take some
time to enjoy doing research, without thinking about much else (besides
finishing my PhD projects). After a year and a half, I decided that it was
time to look for a position somewhere. For family and historical reasons,
I first decided to try the French CRNS (it&#39;s short for National Center for
Scientific Research). CNRS positions have great upsides (lifetime position,
no teaching, no administrative work unless you absolutely want to), and
great downsides (low pay, almost no recognition, funding concentrated on a
minority of people, limited opportunities to train students). But most of the
CNRS staff scientists I worked with seemed happy enough, and a pure-research
position was appealing to me (at this time).</p>

<p>The CNRS is a public organism, and so researchers are civil servants. This
means that the application and hiring process is relatively strange, and
possibly unique. There is a yearly call for applications, with a fixed
number of positions for each of the 52-or-so thematic sections. Lucky me,
I had a general enough background to apply to 29 (Ecology and evolution),
30 (Ecosystems), and 51 (Multi-disciplinary, mathematics and informatics
for life sciences and physics). Some of these positions are &quot;coloured&quot;
(<em>A candidate with knowledge of information theory to work on connectomes
in a human health group</em>), but the others (that would be between one and
four for each section) are open.</p>

<h2 id="the-application">The application</h2>

<p>To apply, you need a research program. This is approximately all of the
information you are given (<em>Describe your research program</em>), and so you won&#39;t
make it without insider knowledge. I sent a couple emails to newly hired CNRS
researchers, and received four entirely different documents. I decided to do
it my way, and wrote a 10-pages, 100-references, 5-years research program
with short terms projects and long terms objectives. I later got feedback
on it from jury or jury-related people: <em>It showed great maturity</em>; <em>It did
not seem really mature</em>; <em>It was a bit fuzzy</em>; <em>It was too specific</em>. I have
a feeling that the candidates are not the only ones not to have guidelines...</p>

<p>The next thing you need is a summary of your research, with an indication of
what was your role in each contribution (paper), and what was the impact of
each contribution. Canadian grant applications ask that for your top 3 or top
5 contributions (or group of contributions). For the CNRS, you have to do it
for all your papers. I had around 20 when I applied. Once again faced with no
guidance, I put the publications in chronological order, and wrote a 300 to
500 words blurb addressing my role and the impact it had on the field. Did I
got informal feedback on it after the decisions? Yes! <em>You have published on
very different topics, it shows you can adapt to new situations</em>; <em>You have
published on very different topics, it shows you don&#39;t know what you are
doing</em>. More? Yes!! <em>You have published in high-impact journals, it means
you&#39;re good</em>; <em>You have published in high-impact journals more than young
candidates usually do, it means somebody probably wrote the papers for you</em>.</p>

<p>With these two documents written, I submitted them to the three different
sections I applied to, and waited. A few months later, I had the decisions: I
was invited for an interview in the Ecology &amp; evolution and Multi-disciplinary
section. So far, so good. The interviews were a month and a half apart. In
France. During spring time. I had to pay for one of the tickets from Canada
myself, and the lab I was applying to paid for the second plane tickets. I
have family in France, so my expenses were remarkably low, but the whole
ordeal cost me 1500 CAD. There are a lot of discussions in France about the
lack of interest from foreign scientists, or from French post-docs currently
abroad to return; this is why.</p>

<h2 id="the-interview">The interview</h2>

<p>As <a href="http://downwithtime.wordpress.com/2014/04/08/the-job-search-in-france-part-ii/">Simon said</a>, the interview is best summarized as
<em>anticlimactic</em>. Depending on the sections, you talk for 12 to 15 minutes,
and have 10 to 15 minutes of questions. My interview in the Ecology &amp;
evolution section went &quot;OK enough, I guess&quot;. I didn&#39;t made it into the
short-list. The interview with the Multi-disciplinary section went really
well. I made it into the short-list (ranked 6, 4 positions), didn&#39;t got the
position in the end. The big difference between the two was how receptive
the jury was to the methodological side of things. To the surprise of
absolutely no one, my proposal was strongly leaning towards data analysis,
computational science, and applications of graph theory. The math-inclined
people in the Multi-disciplinary section seemed to enjoy it, and we had good
(and very technical) discussions about some particularities of algorithmic
and computational issues. The jury in the Ecology &amp; evolution seemed to
block on the methodological side of things.</p>

<p>As an aside, this has been a recurring problem for me. Network-related things
seems off-putting to a lot of people, and I have read more than once in reviews
that the very precise and well-defined terminology of network analysis was
&quot;jargon&quot;. I know that the onus is on me to translate the vocabulary and do
a lot of pedagogy, but I suspect that there is a - small - core of people
that want nothing to do with networks.</p>

<h2 id="the-after">The after</h2>

<p>I received the decisions around June. Even though I am fairly critical of how
hard it is to navigate the whole process, and how inconsistent the feedback
I received was, I am quite happy about the experience. It&#39;s hard not to think
that there is a lot of place left to personal feelings of jury members instead
of having well-defined items for evaluation; this is understandable if you
are going to interact with these people on a daily basis, but if you are only
going to meet them during the interview, this is less understandable. Anyway,
this is symptomatic of how France works as a country (or of how us French work
as people); it has advantages (you can adjust the rules to your feelings),
and inconveniences (you can adjust the rules to your feelings), and in any case
there will be numerous and loudly explained complaints with much arms waving.</p>

<p>What did I get out of the experience? First, a good research program. It
changed over time, I think for the better, but it was the first time I had
to put the last 4 years of my research in perspective in an integrated,
meaningful ways. I also thought in depth about what type of projects I
wanted to do in five or ten years, and that resulted in re-directing current
projects, and starting new ones, and merging one or three that felt out of
touch with the new insights I gained on what I wanted to do. It also gave
me a full year to think about the type of position I wanted. After spending
the previous winter teaching, I decided that a full-time research position
would be good, but a more North-American professorship would be better. A
few months of self-introspection later, I started writing up a teaching and
research statement for future job searches. And so began the second chapter
of my tales, <em>The Crossing of the Desert</em>.</p>
