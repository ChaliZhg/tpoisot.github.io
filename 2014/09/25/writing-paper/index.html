<div class='post-meta'>Written by Tim</div>
<p>I must make a confession. Through no one&#39;s fault bu my own, I made it through
my PhD without a writing method. Not that I knew how to write, and did not
have a routine. I had no method. When it was time to write a paper, I opened a
text editor and started writing a paper. It now sounds head-bashingly stupid;
it is. It is a wonder that I managed to get any writing done. I started
developping an idea of how to write during my post-doc. Mostly by osmosis,
and in part because I needed to do more in less time. And before you get
the wrong idea, this is not about <em>what</em> to write, or whether or not your
paper will be accepted faster. This is not a perfect approach, and different
people probably do need different ways to tackle a paper. But it works for
me, and it is easy to do.</p>

<p>Whenever I have a chance, I tell a variation of the following to students:
&quot;You don&#39;t start a paper by opening a text editor, you don&#39;t start a
presentation by making the title slide, and you don&#39;t start a program by
opening a code editor&quot;. These are the <em>last</em> steps. What comes before,
is the thinking and the planning. Writing the paper is the <em>boring</em> part,
because (in my opinion), it is the <em>obvious</em> part. When I follow my usual
writing method, I have no surprises when writing the paper. So here it goes,
the three-step approach to eternal success and good luck in your academic
writing (<em>patent pending</em>): start with an outline, tell a story, go top-down.</p>

<h1 id="start-with-an-outline">Start with an outline</h1>

<p>Your are probably disappointed at this point. Start with an outline, is that
the big advice? Oh boy. Start with an outline is probably the most often given
advice when writing a paper, and for a reason; unless you are writing a very
narrative piece, it works. But I really do mean <em>start</em> with an outline,
that is, before or as long as you are doing the things that will go in the
paper. I&#39;ve had a few brainstorming session when we thought about what the
figures would look like, what type of data we would get, and how different
mechanisms would give different results. In 90% of the cases, the final
figures where different, but at least we had an idea of where we were headed.</p>

<p>So the first outline is not necessarily a list of bullet points. It is a
loose mix of drawings, keywords, references, and the relationships between
them. It&#39;s more of a roadmap than an outline, but it serves (for me) one really
important purpose: how different results (represented by figures) fall into
the global narrative of the paper. Because, you see, I like it when papers...</p>

<h1 id="...-tell-a-story">... tell a story</h1>

<p>And by a story, I don&#39;t mean the particular story of how I came from the
idea to the first figures to subsequent fine-scale analysis to the grand
conclusion. This is only marginally interesting to me, and it is certainly
not interesting to people reading the paper. And so most of the times, the
results or idea are introduced in the paper in a way that does not reflect
the chronology of how the research happened. More than once, things that
emerged later in the analysis where re-pitched into being the main focus of
the paper, and so we ended up telling a different story.</p>

<p>What I mean is that a paper needs to have a plot: expose the initial situation
(<em>We have this theory about A, and it&#39;s working well at predicting this and
this, and here are the core mechanisms</em>), then introduce a perturbation
(<em>But you see, there is dataset D, and it contradicts the predictions
made under the relevant theory</em>). This is what I write first, and this is
usually the introduction. Then, write the dénouement (<em>In fact, mechanisms
B and C interact in this weird way under particular circumustances, so you
need to account that.</em>). This is the plot (also the first paragraph of the
discussion). What I do next is flesh out the story, that is all the little
steps that go from the initial question to the conclusion. And for that,
I usually...</p>

<h1 id="...-go-top-down">... go top-down</h1>

<p>Let&#39;s get back to the outline. At this point, the context is defined, the
question in known, and because I have usually preliminary results, I can write
the conclusion. What I do next is writing the outline, in a top-down way. I
start with the big sub-divisions of the paper (introduction, model/methods,
results, discussion). Then below each (except model/methods), I list the
main ideas of each paragraph, in a very explicit way. I try to keep that
within one, active voice, declarative sentence (<em>Coexistence happens under
source-sink dynamics at intermediate dispersal levels</em>). This is the summary
of each paragraph. When this is done for all main headings (and I usually
spend a bit of time tweaking it about), the whole outline should read like
a coherent paragraph. This is when I break out my red pen, and under each
single sentence, I list (i) the 2 or 3 key references, and (ii) the figures
or tables that will be refered to. In most cases, I will also break each
paragraph into three sub-points, especially if it is a key paragraph.</p>

<p>I think that this method has important advantages. First, because I write the
actualy outline late (I start with a conceptual idea of the paper, then go
through producing the results, then start writing the outline), it&#39;s easy to
base it on whatever material I already have.  Second, because paragraphs tend
to be of approximately equal size, I can see whether one or more parts are
bloated, and move things around (also good to estimate word count). Third,
it is easier to get an idea of the overal flaw of the paper. If one of the
paragraphs reads <em>Ponder on semi-related litterature from sub-field you
enjoy despite never having worked in it</em> (one of my biases), then I can
immediately see that it does not fit within the macro-level structure of
the paper. Cut. Finally, it gives constraints when writing. For this is the
final step:</p>

<h1 id="writing">Writing</h1>

<p>Once I have the outline, that I have made sure that the story flows and
there are no gaps in the story, and that the paragraphs are balanced, it&#39;s
time to start writing.</p>

<p>This is as good a place as any to mention that all of the above takes place
in a notebook (currently a hardcover plain white Moleskine, though I&#39;m a
bit disappointed by the shoddy quality of the paper, especially since they
are so expensive). Notebooks are good, because you can carry them anywhere,
they don&#39;t run out of power, and they boot faster than a laptop. See? This
paragraph cuts the flow. I would have removed it from the outline.</p>

<p>Anyways. When it&#39;s time to start writing -- on a computer, I can start
wherever I want. If I&#39;m in the mood to review some conceptual papers, I
can write parts of the introduction. Or the results. I just need to look
at the summary of the paragraph to know what to talk about. Then I look at
the paragraph before and after, to know how my paragraph shoul begin and
end. Everything in the paragraph needs to help the &quot;story&quot; move forward.</p>

<p>The other advantage (and it has became a selling point over the last few
months, where I have mostly been able to work on very short chunks), is that
I don&#39;t have to think too much about what to write. The job is already broken
down. So I don&#39;t say <em>I have to write that paper</em>. I say, <em>I have to write 300
words about how this statistical bias affects the computational efficiency
of null models</em>. This is much less daunting. Writing 300 words is nothing,
especially when you already know the big story.</p>

<h1 id="parting-words">Parting words</h1>

<p>So here is my method -- if you want to make your life easier when writing a
paper, try to delay the actual writing until the last moment (advisors of
the world, sorry!). If all of the planning and all of the thinking ahead
has been done, then the actual writing is a matter of connecting the dots.</p>

<p>I have also noticed that it made me writer shorter, thighter papers. Probably
because it is easier (for me) to spend one or two additional paragraphs
rambling about things, which I can&#39;t do if I stick to my outline (this method
is <em>entirely</em> about me trying to cope with my terrible habits). If found
that it worked surprisingly well for grant applications, too! The sections
are already given, and (in one recent case) there are size limits for each
sub-header: I spent a lot of time working on which paragraphs to write whithin
each to meet the space constraints, and it made writing considerably easier
than under my previous strategy (write 15000 words and cut).</p>

<p>I&#39;m not pretending that this method will work for you -- or that I follow
it strictly at all times. But overall, it made me more productive in my
writing. If the outline is good, and the story is thight, there are much
less chances than a massive re-writing would be needed. And although I don&#39;t
have any other evidences than anecdotal ones, I suspect that it makes things
easier to read and follow for the readers.</p>
