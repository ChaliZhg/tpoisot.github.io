             <h2>My worst experience as a teacher</h2>
<p class="meta">21 Feb 2014</p>

<div class="post">
<p>The other day, I was part of a short discussion about our <em>worst</em> teaching
experiences. I was wondering between the time a first-year student set its
bench and lab report on fire (albeit for a short time, for ethanol is a good
combustible), and the time a second year student told me I should cut the
class on classical population dynamics models, because what is the point of
that for <em>ecologists</em>? Then a few days later, I remembered another incident,
which was much less likely to make people laugh; but also one that was much
more difficult to handle.</p>

<hr />

<p>I was a <em>moniteur</em> during my <em>PhD</em>. Being a <em>moniteur</em> is much like being a
teacher assistant, with almost no supervision, absolutely no formal training
(though we did have an introductory class on <em>self expression</em>, and I have
a vague recollection of failing at my <em>Basic computer litteracy</em> test, which
ought to be called <em>Using Microsoft Word and PowerPoint</em>). Your only duty as
a <em>moniteur</em> is to fill your quota of hours, 64 hours a year. But because you
cannot do <em>less</em> than 64 hours, and if classes come in 20 or 40 hours, unless
you can find someone to give you very short teaching gigs to reach exactly 64
hours, you’re in for (unpaid, did I need to mention) overtime. And for some
reason, spending one <em>actual</em> hour in front of a class may count for 30, 60,
or 90 minutes of work, so if you are unlucky, or if your teaching mentor has
no nice gigs to give you, you can expect to do over 100 hours of <em>effective</em>
teaching each year (not counting preparation, grading, and exam</p>

<p>But such is one (out of many) cost that comes with having a <em>great</em> university
system: one that allows anyone to enter regardless of income.</p>

<hr />

<p>It would be tempting to assume that Montpellier (the city, and the
university), is a hotbed of soial <em>mixity</em>. As in almost all old cities
in France, there is a still present old bourgeoisie, and a new working and
lower class peole making (approximately) 80% of the overall population. All
of these people hang out in (almost) the same streets, and go to (almost)
the same universities. But that is far from the truth; Montpellier is a
great example of social <em>juxtaposition</em>, where people from different classes
co-occur but seldom interact.</p>

<p>The fascinating thing is that, especially in the school system, some try
to fake it. It’s fashionable to adopt dressing codes and attitudes (or
perceptions of the attitudes) of “the others”. Dressing though is a way not
to be ostracized for the fact that you have more disposable income than 80%
of your classmates, and dressing nice (loosely meaning, expensive), is a
way not to project that you are in the lower 10%.</p>
