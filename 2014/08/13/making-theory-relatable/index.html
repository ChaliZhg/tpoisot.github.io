      <p>Last November, I was attending the <em>International Biogeogaphic Society</em> special meeting on species interactions. The first keynote speaker, <a href="http://nature.berkeley.edu/~gillespie/Home.html">Rosemary Gillespie</a>, mentioned that one of the most important piece of advice she received was to find a model system, understand it as much as you can, and use it as a basis against which other systems can be compared. Her and her group are doing some stunning things on the biogeography of spiders on the Hawaii archipelago, so it’s hard to argue against this approach. This little piece of advice was picked up by a majority speakers during the meeting, and they were all very passionate about the species or field sites they were studying.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I’m essentially system-agnostic. So I decided to make a little joke during my talk, and showed a picture of my own model system (the laptop) at the margin of its habitat (a two minutes walk from the nearest power outlet) – this particular species has since been displaced by a fitter invader. It’s true that there are some systems I know more than others. I’m biased towards on microbial interactions, especially involving bacteria and phages. I’m partial to parasites, especially the ones you find in fishes or rodents. But I really don’t care if I have to work on something else.</p>
<p><span class="left"> <img src="/images/laptop.jpg" /> </span></p>
<p>My point of view is: find the most suitable (which to say, the less unsuitable) dataset for the question you have in mind at the moment, and work to understand its particular features that makes things general or not. Is it pollinators? Good. Is it from literature surveys? That’s good too. In fact, as long as it matches your question, anything goes. Which is a central point of my “philosophy” as a data <em>consumer</em>: there is no good, and no bad, dataset. There are datasets matching the question you have in mind, and there are all of the other datasets in the world. I have some projects on the back-burner because I’m still waiting for the good dataset to use to finish them (note that I’m not waiting for the <em>perfect</em> dataset, there is almost never such a thing).</p>
<p>One of the dynamics of scientific collaboration I enjoy the most is when people with a good knowledge of the natural history and people with more conceptual interests team up, and both sides gain improved knowledge. Theoretical (a catch-all term for numerical, computational, conceptual) science cannot exist in a vacuum for a long time, which makes it necessary to work closely with people knowing their system very well. In the preface to a special issue of <em>Interface Focus</em> on theoretical ecology, <span class="citation" data-cites="lev12a">Levin (2012)</span> gives a really convincing historical argument for more interactions between theory and data, and at the same time has this impeccable criticism of purely mathematical approaches to ecological questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The legacy of Volterra and Lotka has not been universally positive, although this is certainly not their fault. The attractive simplicity of the model equations proved irresistible to mathematicians eager to add bells and whistles, with little concern for biological relevance, and to explore their tortured implications in painful detail. <strong>This has produced a large literature, harmless except for its effect on perceptions of the field of mathematical biology, and its obfuscation of the cryptic nuggets that sometimes lie within</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>A while ago, we submitted a purely theoretical paper (it has been accepted since I started writing this post), which one may be tempted to file into the <em>adding bells and whistles</em> category. This paper is, for the largest part, an analytical treatment of a modified version of host-symbiont dynamic models, with some simulations by the end. It was broad enough that we used a general language to describe the type of organisms we were modelling. We didn’t just called them <em>organisms</em>, but that was close enough; that’s how general that paper is, and it certainly does not apply to a particular ecosystem. One of the referees reported that it was interesting and sound, but he couldn’t recommend acceptation, because it did not bring any new insight about any specific system in nature. It is always a harsh thing to read about your work as a theoretician (seeing your work dismissed as, essentially, <em>unreal</em> – an interesting but futile exercise). Luckily, the associate editor replied with the following comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is always one of those complicated issues for models - true biological reality means it isn’t a model, it is nature. But it is also true that for a model to make sense to empiricists it has to relate to something they understand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are good words. What I enjoy about this comment is that it highlights both sides of the responsibility to close the gap between empirical and theoretical sciences. On one hand, we have to accept that all of the details or our favorite empirical system are unlikely to be captured by a model, and that this is not (necessarily) a reason not to consider the model at all. On the other hand, as Levin pointed out, us theoreticians have to make modelling relatable, and I’ll talk a bit more about that.</p>
<p>I think there are two ways to make mathematically-grounded theoretical work relatable to non theoreticians. The first is trying to reproduce an empirical system in all of its details, so as to be able to predict a lot about little. The second way (which is close to what I do) is to use models that are general enough to capture a broad range of phenomenons, and explain (in the text) where they do and don’t apply to ecological systems. Both sides of the discussion have been covered by <span class="citation" data-cites="eva13">Evans et al. (2013)</span> (and surprisingly they call for more focused, small-scale models, because the high-order ones make so many assumptions that they end up being irrelevant).</p>
<p>One of the issues I have with pure-theory journals (which I think is why I read them, review papers for some, but don’t intend to publish there any time soon), is that they tend to favor papers in which a lot of emphasis is put on mathematical prowess, and very little on making the paper relatable to a broad audience. Not that this is a bad thing <em>per se</em>, but perhaps it explains the citation gap between empirical and theoretical works <span class="citation" data-cites="faw12a">(Fawcett and Higginson 2012)</span>: this indicates a tendency to discard papers with equations as being primarily mathematics, even though they address biological questions – I wonder if the citation gap is as strong in ecology, which has a rich tradition of quantitative research. If there is an echo chamber of theoretical papers (I’m not assuming there is, or that it would be a bad thing assuming we can have some synthesis once in a while), in which making the paper relatable to empiricists is not a priority, then it should not be a surprise that empiricists do not relate to the paper (and therefore do not cite it).</p>
<p>An interesting point to keep in mind is that (most) theoretical papers require empirical science as an input. So most of the efforts needed to close the loop would be to make sure that more theoretical science goes into empirical one. Which takes (I think) three different ingredients. First, at the system scale, increasing quantitative skills <span class="citation" data-cites="bar13b">(Barraquand et al. 2013)</span> so that no one is <em>afraid</em> of equations anymore. Second, putting an end to the idea that results not obtained through empirical approaches are untrue (they are most likely quantitatively wrong but qualitatively insightful). And finally, an increase in the efforts made by theoreticians to <em>reach out</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p>My own perspective on the way forward is to increase collaborations. I am not comfortable with the ideas of <em>theoretical ecology</em> sessions in conferences, because it is essentially a statement that while other fields are defined by their questions (<em>community</em>, <em>landscape</em>, <em>evolutionary</em>, …), one sub-field can be summarized only by its approaches. This contributes to the reproductive barrier (for ideas!) between the sub-fields. Projects relying heavily on data analysis are always a good opportunity, because the people having collected the data have some knowledge about them that is not necessarily apparent in the data themselves. But I have been involved lately in two really good projects where toy models were used as a supplement to purely empirical science. This felt really right! My personal preference is clearly for this type of approaches. None of these papers are going to break any new ground from a mathematical modelling point of view, but the addition of models helped greatly in the interpretation of the results (hence, breaking some new <em>ecological</em> ground).</p>
<p>And lastly, let’s not forget that models often do not have the last word. Charles Krebs recently synthesized <a href="https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~krebs/ecological_rants/?p=786">40 years of research on the lynx-hare population cycles</a>, and this is a really entertaining and informative post to read. The lynx-hare data are often mentioned as an example of demographic control by predators, or of tri-trophic interactions. And indeed, several population dynamical models are able to reproduce cyclic oscillations really well. The interesting point, however, is that in nature, it all boils down to predator-induced stress, which is inherited through maternal effects. The models are able to reproduce the data very well, but the models are wrong. I like this idea of models that help sorting through hypotheses, and acting as prior information. But if we are not doing mathematical biology for the sake of mathematics, then empirical confirmation matters.</p>
<p>It’s fine to have people passionate about a species, a field site, or an experimental system. It’s fine to have people doing ecological research from the comfort of their office chair. But the most important is to have a concerted effort to use as much methods as we can to answer questions. Whether this involves muddy boots, a few hundred microcosms, or whatever it is theoreticians scribble in their notebooks… the more the merrier!</p>
