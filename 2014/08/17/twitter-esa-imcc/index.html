      <p>August is conference season. But for the last few years, not being able to attend does not mean that you can’t partake in the global discussion, as more and more scientific meetings have been using twitter hashtags to keep the discussion going online. Being both a fervent twitter user, and interested in all things networks, I decided to explore the assembly of the graph of interactions among scientists over time. A bunch of us are doing a more formal analysis of the <em>Ecological Society of America</em> 2014 meeting, but here I will present a brief comparison of <code>#ESA2014</code> with <code>#IMCC3</code>, the <em>International Marine Conservation Congress</em>.</p>
<p>Both meetings took place almost at the same time, were massively using their respective hashtag, and are within the same broad field of environmental sciences. I won’t go into the details, but here is what I’ve been doing. I used the Twitter API to pull all tweets containing either <code>#ESA2014</code> or <code>#IMCC3</code>. For all of these tweets, I looked at who wrote it, and who was mentioned in it. If a tweet written by <code>@bob</code> mentionned <code>@alice</code>, I recorded one interaction from <code>@bob</code> to <code>@alice</code>, along with the time, and the meeting in which it occured. Because the use of twitter was <em>massive</em>, this resulted in a little more than 3500 people, mentionning each other over 20000 times.</p>
<p>I was mostly interested in how using Twitter can help bring people together over time, which in a network perspective is akin to measuring modularity, and how it decreases.</p>

<p>OK, so first (keeping in mind that <code>#IMCC3</code> is still going), what does the dynamics of number of tweets looks like? I divided the dataset in bins of approximately 10 hours, and looked at the number of tweets, and number of users.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the use of hashtags allows the conversation to start <em>before</em> the actual meeting does. And, oh yeah, shame on us ecologists, the IMCC crowd is way better at twitter than we are! With roughly the same number of people involved, they manage to talk twice as much as we do. Actually, let’s look at the cumulative number of tweets exchanged:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">plot</span>(xseq, <span class="kw">laply</span>(a_all, ecount), <span class="dt">lwd=</span><span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dt">type=</span><span class="st">&#39;l&#39;</span>, <span class="dt">lty=</span><span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="dt">xlab=</span><span class="st">&#39;Date&#39;</span>, <span class="dt">ylab=</span><span class="st">&#39;Cumulative tweets&#39;</span>)

<figure>
<img src="/figure/tweet_vcount_cum.png" alt="Cumulative number of participants in both meetings. #IMCC3 is taking off extremely fast, compared to the more modest growth of #esa2014." /><figcaption>Cumulative number of participants in both meetings. <code>#IMCC3</code> is taking off extremely fast, compared to the more modest growth of <code>#esa2014</code>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Whereas the number of <code>#ESA2014</code> tweets ends-up stagnating, the <code>#IMCC3</code> conversation keeps on going. If I had to propose an explanation, I think it would be that marine sciences and conservation are really to get people interested in (especially since it was <em>Shark Week</em> recently). Ecology <em>should</em> be the same, but we have a long way to go.</p>
<p>So what about modularity? I used the walktrap method, which is based on short (of size 3) random walks, to determine the membership of people to communities, and then I measured the overall modularity. This goes from 0 (everyone is connected to everyone else) to 1 (groups of well connected people are not connected to one another).</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">mod &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>function(x) <span class="kw">modularity</span>(<span class="kw">walktrap.community</span>(x))
<span class="kw">plot</span>(xseq, <span class="kw">laply</span>(a_all, mod), <span class="dt">lwd=</span><span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dt">type=</span><span class="st">&#39;l&#39;</span>, <span class="dt">lty=</span><span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="dt">xlab=</span><span class="st">&#39;Date&#39;</span>, <span class="dt">ylab=</span><span class="st">&#39;Modularity&#39;</span>, <span class="dt">ylim=</span><span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="dv">0</span>,<span class="dv">1</span>))

<span class="kw">lines</span>(xseq, <span class="kw">laply</span>(a_imcc, mod), <span class="dt">col=</span><span class="st">&quot;darkblue&quot;</span>)</code></pre>
<figure>
<img src="/figure/tweet_modularity.png" alt="In both meetings, modularity decreases over time.

Note that the <code>#imcc3</code> meeting ws <em>less</em> modular even at the beginning of the analysis.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I like this figure! The <code>#ESA2014</code> meeting is not that modular by the end (a modularity around 0.4 indicates that some clusters exists, but they are overall well-connected). On the other hand, <code>#IMCC3</code> is really well connected. Keeping in mind that the number of contributors is similar, this means that the <code>#IMCC3</code> community is much more uniform than the <code>#ESA2014</code> community is. This can be because the span of <code>#IMCC3</code> is more narrow (whereas <code>#ESA2014</code> is about <em>all</em> ecology), or this can be that the sense of belonging to a community is more developed in marine conservation people.</p>
<p>Let’s now look at the diameter (the maximum distance between two nodes) in the two graphs:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">plot</span>(xseq, <span class="kw">laply</span>(a_all, diameter), <span class="dt">lwd=</span><span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dt">type=</span><span class="st">&#39;l&#39;</span>, <span class="dt">lty=</span><span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="dt">xlab=</span><span class="st">&#39;Date&#39;</span>, <span class="dt">ylab=</span><span class="st">&#39;Diameter&#39;</span>, <span class="dt">ylim=</span><span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="dv">0</span>,<span class="dv">20</span>))
<span class="kw">lines</span>(xseq, <span class="kw">laply</span>(a_esa, diameter), <span class="dt">col=</span><span class="st">&quot;darkgreen&quot;</span>)
<span class="kw">lines</span>(xseq, <span class="kw">laply</span>(a_imcc, diameter), <span class="dt">col=</span><span class="st">&quot;darkblue&quot;</span>)</code></pre>
<figure>
<img src="/figure/tweet_diameter.png" alt="Diameter (maximal distance between two contributors) in both conferences. Keeping in mind that #IMCC3 has more contributors, the fact that it has a lower diameter means that the interactions between them are indeed closer." /><figcaption>Diameter (maximal distance between two contributors) in both conferences. Keeping in mind that <code>#IMCC3</code> has more contributors, the fact that it has a lower diameter means that the interactions between them are indeed closer.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This tells the same story: with a diameter of 10, against 7 for <code>#IMCC3</code>, <code>#ESA2014</code> is a more disjointed community. As a final note, I will release both datasets when <code>#IMCC3</code> tweets stop accumulating.</p>
