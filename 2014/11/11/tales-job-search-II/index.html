<p><a href="http://timotheepoisot.fr/2014/09/24/tales-job-search-I/">Last time</a>, I told the story of my application to French academic jobs, the really weird process of applying and interviewing, and (ultimately) the rejection. After taking a few months to think about it, I decided to apply to more “standard” positions. My main motivation was (still is) that I wanted more teaching, and more interactions with students, than the French system usually offers.</p>
<p>There were a few jobs openings at this time, and I went through the process of putting together a research and teaching statement, updating my resume, and all that. Over a period of a few months, I ended up with a quite nice package to send around. Papers were coming out, too, so I figured that my first interview was going to happen soon enough (I was wrong). I was not in any particular hurry to get a job (I just signed up for a post-doc with two years of funding), so I carefully selected where I would like to apply.</p>
<p>I sent two applications. I got two negative replies. This chapter or my job search was a whole year of nothing much happening (by choice), and a few weeks of wondering when I would have a decision, followed by a rejection letter. It was boring, and anti-climactic to an extreme.</p>
<p>Then some time in spring (or whatever passes for spring in Québec), my wife and I discovered that we were soon going to be parents. Both of us are biologists, so we were well aware that this event was well within the expected confidence interval. But still we had to deal with all of the practical details. One of the most pressing being that I kicked myself in the metaphorical nuts, and decided to get a position.</p>
<p>I would have been happy to keep on applying to position periodically for a year or two – life as a post-doc is pretty sweet when you are not running after funding – but having to take care of baby required a little bit more certainties about where we will be in the medium term. And when I was attending a conference in Montreal in August, I heard about an opening in numerical ecology. That seemed like a dream job (still does!), so I decided to apply. That will be the story of part 3…</p>
