<div class='post-meta'>Written by Tim</div>
<p>The main appeal of scientific meetings is that you get to see results, and what
other people are working on, before any of it is published (and free food --
seriously, oh so much free food). Given that there is an increasing number
of people <a href="/2014/08/17/twitter-esa-imcc/">using Twitter</a> to cover meetings, it&#39;s no surprise that there
is an active discussion about what is off-limits, in terms of what to tweet,
and what to keep on the down low. To have an idea of the range of different
opinions and issues, you <em>should</em> read open science advocate extraordinaire
<a href="http://blogs.egu.eu/palaeoblog/2014/11/13/lets-have-a-discussion-about-live-tweeting-academic-conferences/">Jon Tennant&#39;s blog post</a> on the topic.</p>

<p>Many folks have been calling for event-level policy. <a href="https://twitter.com/sfnpolice">SFN14</a>, for example,
banned all live-tweeting while the sessions were proceeding. <a href="https://www.grc.org/about.aspx">Gordon Research
Conferences</a> are notoriously restrictive about what you can share of
the events that transpire during them (hint: nothing). Event-level policies
might be good, but they have the huge problem of effectively overruling
individual opinions about what is tweetable or not.</p>

<p>I start my talks with a slide saying that <em>everything</em> is fair game as long as
I get credit for it (that&#39;s the basis of the <em>CC-BY 4.0</em> license, under which
I release most of my non-code, non-data stuff, including this very blog). You
can record the audio (Worst. Podcast. Ever.), a video, take pictures of
the slides, and share them online as long as my name is attached to it in
some way. Starting from a few months ago, every slide set I presented had
a DOI attached to it, and more often than not, it is given somewhere in the
slides. And I made it a rule to <em>never</em> present already published material
at meetings. No one wants to hear me talk for 12 minutes about <em>anything</em>
when the alternative is reading the paper in warm, comforting silence.</p>

<p>Slides that present results, in particular, seem to be the most problematic. I
have a lot of trouble following the argument. Some people opposed to having
them shared online (as is their right to do -- if they don&#39;t want you to
share, don&#39;t share). But the argument that is usually given is &quot;people might
see my results&quot;. As opposed to the people that are sitting in the session,
that will close their eyes, put their fingers in their ears, and go <em>na-na-na
can&#39;t hear you</em> until the non-results part of the talk is reached, I suppose.</p>

<p>All sarcasm left aside, I understand that the fear of getting scooped is
real in some people, and justified in some fields (I don&#39;t think it is the
case in ecology, fortunately). But the whole point of going to a conference
is that people will see your slides. And hear what you have to say about
them. If your fear is of being scooped, the people <em>in the room</em> that have
access to the slide in context are much more threatening that the people
that will only see one blurry picture and a one-sentence summary on twitter.</p>

<p>Having your science shared on twitter (unless it is &quot;holy cow you guys
look at how bad this paper is!&quot;) is all win for you. It&#39;s free publicity
about what you do (so people might go to your website and check your other
papers, or go read the preprint, or send you emails to talk about it). And
because twitter only allows short messages, at best, people will only have
a photo and a single sentence. This is very, very far from enough material
to reproduce a paper and scoop you.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s a great ego boost too! A few months ago, I was talking in a room
with no clock, so I laid my phone on the stand in front of me. And people
<em>in the room</em> where saying good things about my talk. This is real-time
feedback, and it feels <em>awesome</em>. Seeing that the fruit of your labor is
making people in a positive way in real time never happens in science except
in this particular context.</p>

<p>To wrap things up -- I am fine with conference-level policies, as long as
they allow each individual speaker to decide how much can be shared, and
how. This is why we have open (and closed, too) licenses, and they apply to
all sorts of intellectual property. It would be productive for conferences
to state the default (assumed) policy, in case speakers are not explicit. It
would make sense that this default be opt-in: if the speaker says nothing,
you can&#39;t share. But saying <em>all sharing is prohibited</em> is absurd; conference
organizers have many jobs, none of which involves deciding, for me, how I
can or cannot share my own research.</p>
