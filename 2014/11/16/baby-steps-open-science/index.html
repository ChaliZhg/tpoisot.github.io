<div class='post-meta'>Written by Tim</div>
<p>The always excellent and insightful Christie Bahlai has a great blog post
about <em><a href="https://practicaldatamanagement.wordpress.com/2014/10/23/baby-steps-for-the-open-curious/">Baby steps for the open curious</a></em>. <em>Open curious</em>, a term
that was coined during a meeting of <a href="http://innge.net/wiki/index.php/Open_Science">INNGE&#39;s Open Science group</a> refers
to people that <em>would like</em> to start adopting more open practices, but are
not sure how to do it, or are still concerned by some of the perceived risks.</p>

<p><img src="/images/babysteps.jpg" alt="Baby steps!">Our son is learning
to stand up and walk, so the metaphor of baby steps is one I can relate
to. There are three things to baby steps. You can&#39;t be too ambitious,
you can&#39;t (probably) do it on your own, and it&#39;s scary (for both the baby
and the parents, as far as actual baby steps are concerned). You need to
build up, slowly, and have someone guide you through the whole process.
This is a perfect metaphor for open science.</p>

<p>In a few months, I will have my first (very own) students, and I want them
to be open scientists. I want to train them to do transparent research, be
accountable for what they do and how they do it, and make sure their research
has <em>all</em> of the possible sorts of impact. Open science is the shortest path
to success, because people can actually build on what you do, reproduce it,
and give you credit for it. And it makes you a good <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/549/">academic citizen</a>
too! I am in the process of completing the <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a>
instructor training; in part because it will help me train these and other
students better. There is much emphasis on how to bring people that know
very little to being able to do things independently. This, too, applies to
open science as a whole.</p>

<p>Being an open scientist is <em>complicated</em>, because we don&#39;t even have a clear
and consensual definition of what it means. I publish in non open access
journals, for example. But these non-OA papers are available as preprints. It
is open, but is it open enough? This is one of the problems that we will have
to overcome if we want to help people do more open science; we can&#39;t just
say <em>release ALL your things</em>. It&#39;s vague, it&#39;s frightening, and I don&#39;t know
a single person that woke up one morning, and released <em>ALL</em> its things. It
has been, I guess, a long, gradual, and iterative process for most of us.</p>

<p>When someone asks &quot;How do I do open science?&quot;, it&#39;s rude to say &quot;See all the
things I do? Do them too.&quot;. Everyone has a different workflow. Saying &quot;To
do open science, do things this way&quot; is counterproductive. The constructive
reply would be &quot;Show me what you do, and I will try to give you tips about
how to make things more open&quot;.</p>

<p>This approach has a lot of benefits over presenting The One True Open Science
Workflow. First, it slices the problem (How to make my research open?) into
a lot of very small tasks, most of which will require very little time to
implement. Second, people will be able to <em>decide</em> which to do, if any, and
when they do it. I suspect that most people will be tempted to follow the
advice of <em><a href="http://choosealicense.com/">pick an open source license</a></em>, instead of <em><a href="http://software-carpentry.org/v5/novice/sql/index.html">ditch Excel
and use a database</a></em>. We won&#39;t reach the point where 100% of research
is open (unless funding agency enforce it, and there is a non-0 probability
that this will happen); that&#39;s too bad.</p>

<p>If people are <em>open curious</em>, and I suspect most people are, they <em>want</em>
to learn about open science. It would be awfully counterproductive to turn
them off by requiring that they start again from scratch. Working with them
at identifying areas where small changes can have a big impact is key. I
think we need more mentoring, and more of an open-door policy for open
curious people, if we want more research to be open over time.</p>
