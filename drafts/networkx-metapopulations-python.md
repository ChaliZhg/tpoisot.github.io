Python progressively replaced R for most of my simulations. There are a lot of great packages for scientists, and since I started working on 

We had a lab meeting this afternoon about ...

# Create a node class

The first thing to do is to create a class for the patches, which will be the nodes of our spatial graph.

# Create a spatially explicit graph

# Simulation
