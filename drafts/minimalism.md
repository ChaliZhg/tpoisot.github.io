I still feel bad calling myself a theoretician. Sure, I spend most of my time in the field (two to three days a year) running away from bugs, I am not too comfortable in a labcoat (they actually do more harm than good when you don't [know how to properly wear it](http://jcm.asm.org/content/35/4/988.short) anyway), and I spend a good share of my time either re-analysing other peoples' data, writing models, geeking around, and generally thinking about stuff (we call this "conceptualizing"). But truth be told, most of my formation until my PhD was not really focused on maths, or theory, and I still feel like I'm catching up.
