I've been reading a really interesting paper by xxxx in Ideas in Ecology & Evolution, and I was really surprized that the general consensus among the ecological community is that referees should be paid $100 by review. This is a high figure, as even with really liberal estimates of the time invested in a review, it is an hourly rate of approximately $10. This is certainly a strong incentive to stop the tragedy of the reviewers commons, but there is another way to get benefits from your reviews (aside from the reputational benefit you can get by signing them).
