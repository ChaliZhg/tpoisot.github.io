I've been reading [Tim Gowers's fascinating blog](http://gowers.wordpress.com/2012/01/29/whats-wrong-with-electronic-journals/) following the call to boycott Elsevier, and stumbled upon a fascinating *gedankenexperiment*. What would the electronic journal of the future look like in the field of Mathematics? I found myself wondering, what would this next-generation journal look like in ecology, and how would it function on a daily basis?

# The name of the game

# Everything moves

Articles should not be confined to 4 types. Hypotheses, data, opinion, reviews, 

No reason for page limits or number of accepted papers. Am Nat got it wrong, quote the sentence about number of E-papers. Artificial scarcity.

# Quality, and surrogates of quality

Impact factors are a measure of the absolute success of a journal in its field. Yet we all know examples of papers published in really good journals that met a terrible fate (think arsenic in the DNA, the memory of water), or excellent papers that were consistently rejected by major journals (e.g. Leigh van Valen's [Red Queen's hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Queen%27s_Hypothesis)). Some papers were also just plain ignored by the community. Conversely, papers published in obscure journals can really be [hidden gems](http://f1000.com/rankings/hiddenjewels), that will either get highly cited, or be really influential for your research.

For this reason, a next-generation journal should rely heavily on article metrics. [*PLoS One*](http://www.plosone.org/home.action) does that, and to some extent so does [Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com/) through [ReaderMeter](http://nitens.org/taraborelli/ReaderMeter). What would these article-level metrics consist of? The number of downloads, or inclusions in Mendeley or similar services, and the number of citations. And much more importantly, the ratio between these two. If two people download your paper, and they both cite it 3 times, then it can safely be assumed that it had a different kind of impact than a paper downloaded by 150 people, and cited only twice. Not only would it tell you the total impact of this paper, article level metrics would inform you about the kind of impact it achieved:

# Openness is everyhting

# Avoid the tragedy of the commons

A lot of people talked about the [tragedy of the reviewer commons](http://blogs.helsinki.fi/egru-blog/2008/12/20/the-tragedy-of-the-reviewer-commons/), including [Mike Hochberg and colleagues](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2008.01276.x/abstract), [Jeremy Fox & Owen Petchey](http://www.esajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1890/0012-9623-91.3.325) and [Michael Donaldson](http://library.queensu.ca/ojs/index.php/IEE/article/view/4219/4240), and I really cannot stress enough how reading these papers is important. Avoiding this "tragedy" can be quite easily done, if a new journal is ready to tap into an existing community of people *willing* to conduct peer-reviews.

For this reason, a next-generation journal should engage with [Peerage of Science](http://www.peerageofscience.org/). As we discussed on [the INNGE blog](http://innge.net/?q=node/121), they provide an easy way to obtain triple-blind peer-review in a way that is independant from the journal. I'm not a quite fan of triple-blind (or any other n-blind, for that matters) review process, because I strongly believe that [non-anonymous reviews can turn out to be beneficial](http://timotheepoisot.fr/2012/01/29/sign-your-reviews/), if properly done. not a fan of triple-blind for reasons already discussed, but quite interested to see pr done without a journal, i.e. no prejudice to getting rejected.

Can go even further by having a very flexible strategy with associate editors: a lot by invitation, and a small number of people taking the final decision.

# Be social and engage
