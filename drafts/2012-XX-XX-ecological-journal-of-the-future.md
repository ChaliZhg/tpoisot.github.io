I've been reading [Tim Gowers's fascinating blog](http://gowers.wordpress.com/2012/01/29/whats-wrong-with-electronic-journals/) following the call to boycott Elsevier, and stumbled upon a fascinating *gedankenexperiment*. What would the electronic journal of the future look like in the field of Mathematics? I found myself wondering, what would this next-generation journal look like in ecology, and how would it function on a daily basis?

# The name of the game

# Everything moves

When you are 
Articles should not be confined to 4 types. Hypotheses, data, opinion, reviews, 

On the other hand, one of the main reason editors use when declining your paper is "constraints on the number of pages". This just in: some journals are still printed on dead trees. But when is the last time you actually read one of those? I'm not talking about taking a trip to the library to read a paper published in an obscure journal in the early 1950s. With the exception of free issues you collect at meetings, have you ever prefered the paper over the PDF version of an article? If my own habits are of any indication, I'm guessing no. Continue

Note that switching to e-articles will not necessarily mean that constraints will be lifted. When reading the [instructions for authors at *Am. Nat.*](http://www.jstor.org/page/journal/amernatu/forAuthor.html) - and in all likelihood, some other journals with an e-paper alternative are doing it as well, it just so happenned that I was submitting something to *Am Nat* at the time - , I found this (emphasis mine):

> The choice of appearing as an open access e-article is available to all authors, **though the number that can appear with each issue are limited**.  

Sounds an awful lot as [artificial scarcity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_scarcity) to me, and the reason for which to do it is immediately clear: if the number of papers is limited, you will reject average-to-good papers and publish only the *crème de la crème* (super best). Ergo, your impact factor, citation half-life, immediacy index, and all the others will all go up (or down - in any case, they'll go where you want them to). This is all fair and well (although I'll get back to why we should pay less and less attention to these metrics in the next section), but be upfront about it!

# Quality, and surrogates of quality

Impact factors are a measure of the absolute success of a journal in its field. Yet we all know examples of papers published in really good journals that met a terrible fate (think arsenic in the DNA, the memory of water), or excellent papers that were consistently rejected by major journals (e.g. Leigh van Valen's [Red Queen's hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Queen%27s_Hypothesis)). Some papers were also just completely ignored by their expected target community. Conversely, papers published in obscure journals can really be [hidden jewels](http://f1000.com/rankings/hiddenjewels), that will either get highly cited, or be really influential for your research. And this is entirely different.

For this reason, a next-generation journal should rely heavily on article metrics. [*PLoS One*](http://www.plosone.org/home.action) does that, and to some extent so does [Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com/) through [ReaderMeter](http://nitens.org/taraborelli/ReaderMeter). What would these article-level metrics consist of? The number of downloads, or inclusions in Mendeley or similar services, and the number of citations. And much more importantly, the ratio between these two. With dead-trees publishing, you do not have access to this information, because what interest you is the number of people receving a physical copy of a whole issue. Which paper they choose to read, and which they choose to ignore, is not something you can know and monitor. But with the transition to electronic publishing came the log file, and the number of times the link to a pdf was clicked is now readily avaiable. On a side note, I'm taking a wild guess here, but if we assume that the major publishing services keep their logs for a long time, we can actually measure this ratio for already published papers. But how to interpretate it? If two people download your paper, and they both cite it 3 times, then it can safely be assumed that it had a different kind of impact than a paper downloaded by 150 people, and cited only twice. Not only would it tell you the total impact of this paper, article level metrics would inform you about the kind of impact it achieved:

# Openness is everyhting

# Avoid the tragedy of the commons

A lot of people talked about the [tragedy of the reviewer commons](http://blogs.helsinki.fi/egru-blog/2008/12/20/the-tragedy-of-the-reviewer-commons/), including [Mike Hochberg and colleagues](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2008.01276.x/abstract), [Jeremy Fox & Owen Petchey](http://www.esajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1890/0012-9623-91.3.325) and [Michael Donaldson](http://library.queensu.ca/ojs/index.php/IEE/article/view/4219/4240), and I really cannot stress enough how reading these papers is important. Avoiding this "tragedy", which [seems to affect women even more](http://oikosjournal.wordpress.com/2012/03/19/may-the-odds-be-ever-in-your-favor-a-brief-comment-on-the-review-games-in-ecology/), can be quite easily done, if a new journal is ready to tap into an existing community of people *willing* to conduct peer-reviews.

For this reason, a next-generation journal should engage with [Peerage of Science](http://www.peerageofscience.org/). As we discussed on [the INNGE blog](http://innge.net/?q=node/121), they provide an easy way to obtain triple-blind peer-review in a way that is independant from the journal. I'm not a quite fan of triple-blind (or any other n-blind, for that matters) review process, because I strongly believe that [non-anonymous reviews can turn out to be beneficial](http://timotheepoisot.fr/2012/01/29/sign-your-reviews/), if properly done. not a fan of triple-blind for reasons already discussed, but quite interested to see pr done without a journal, i.e. no prejudice to getting rejected. volunteer model: I'd like to do that, instead of, Heym why not?

Can go even further by having a very flexible strategy with associate editors: a lot by invitation, and a small number of people taking the final decision.
