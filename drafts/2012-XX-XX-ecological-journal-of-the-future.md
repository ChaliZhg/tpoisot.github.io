I've been reading [Tim Gowers's fascinating blog](http://gowers.wordpress.com/2012/01/29/whats-wrong-with-electronic-journals/) following the call to boycott Elsevier, and stumbled upon a fascinating *gedankenexperiment*. What would the electronic journal of the future look like in the field of Mathematics? I found myself wondering, what would this next-generation journal look like in ecology, and how would it function on a daily basis?

# The name of the game

# Everything moves

Articles should not be confined to 4 types. Hypotheses, data, opinion, reviews, 

# Quality, and surrogates of quality

Impact factors are a measure of the absolute success of a journal in its field. Yet we all know examples of papers published in really good journals that met a terrible fate (think Arsenic DNA, the memory of water), or just get plain ignored by the community. Conversely, papers published in obscure journals can really be hidden gems, that will either get highly cited, or be really influential for your research. Think of it this way: insert clever metaphors here.

For this reason, a next-generation journal should rely heavily on article metrics. [*PLoS One*]() does that, and to some extent so does [Mendeley](). What would these article-level metrics consist of? The number of downloads or inclusions in Mendeley, and the number of citations. And much more importantly, the ratio between these two. If two people download your paper, and they both cite it 3 times, then it can safely be assumed that it had a different kind of impact than a paper downloaded by 150 people, and cited only twice. Not only would it tell you the total impact of this paper, article level metrics would inform you about the kind of impact it achieved:

# Openness is everyhting

# Avoid the tragedy of the commons

# Be social and engage
