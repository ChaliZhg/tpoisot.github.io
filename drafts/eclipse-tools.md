I started using [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) three months ago, after some time spent with a mixture of [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) (really good, but limited to Python), [RStudio](http://rstudio.org/) (really good, but limited to R), [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/sublime-text-2-beta) (interesting but a little bit too quirky for my tastes), and a variety of others. Eclipse appeared as an interesting alternative, because I was able to manage projects in a bunch of different languages in a single editor. I now enjoy any second of it, and this post was written in Eclipse. Still, it took me a while to get started, especially because I had to find the good set of modules to customize my Eclipse install. I'm mostly programming in C and Python, analyzing data in R, and writing papers in LaTeX. Everything is kept up to date with Git, and from times to times I use a little bit of PERL to get things done with text (PERL is actually the first scripting language I learned, fresh out of high school).

Instead of the Eclipse *Classic* environment, I downloaded the version for C developpers.

StatET/Texlipse, do not work with the custom texlipse plugin

PDF reader

PyCharm

Finally, I always found the Eclipse default theme ugly. So I installed the [Eclipse Color Theme](http://www.eclipsecolorthemes.org/) plugin, which allows me to use various syntaxic coloration. My personal preference goes to [*Tango*](http://www.eclipsecolorthemes.org/?view=theme&id=27), which is contrasted but not too bright or too invasive.
