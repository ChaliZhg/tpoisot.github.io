I started using Eclipse three months ago, after some time spent with a mixture of PyCharm (really good, but limited to Python), RStudio (really good, but limited to R), SublimeText (interesting but a little bit too quirky for my tastes), and a variety of others. Eclipse appeared as an interesting alternative, because I was able to manage projects in a bunch of different languages in a single editor. I now enjoy any second of it, and this post was written in Eclipse. Still, it took me a while to get started, especially because I had to find the good set of modules to customize my Eclipse install. I'm mostly programming in C and Python, analyzing data in R, and writing papers in LaTeX. Everything is kept up to date with Git, and from times to times I use a little bit of PERL to get things done with text (PERL is actually the first scripting language I learned, fresh out of high school).
