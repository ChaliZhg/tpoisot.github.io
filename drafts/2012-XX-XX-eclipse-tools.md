I started using Eclipse three month ago, after some time spent with a mixture of PyCharm (really good, but limited to Python), RStudio (really good, but limited to R), SublimeText (interesting but a little bit too quirky for my tastes), and a variety of others. Eclipse appeared as an interesting alternative, because I was able to manage projects in a bunch of different languages in a single editor.
