Yet there remains a tension between communities as highly structured units or as coincidental collections of individualistic species. We explore these ideas using a new statistical approach that clusters species based on their environmental response- a species archetype, rather than clustering sites based on their species composition. We find that there are groups of species, which are consistently highly correlated, but that these groups are not unique to any set of locations and overlap spatially. The species present at a single site are a realisation of species from the (multiple) archetype groups that are likely to be present at that location based on their response to the environment.", "DOI": "10.1890/13-0789.1", "author": [{"given": "Rebecca", "family": "Leaper"}, {"given": "Piers K.", "family": "Dunstan"}, {"given": "Scott D.", "family": "Foster"}, {"given": "Neville S.", "family": "Barrett"}, {"given": "Graham J.", "family": "Edgar"}], "URL": "http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/13-0789.1", "issued": {"date-parts": [[2014, 1]]}, "container-title": "Ecology", "type": "article-journal"}, {"id": "jul06", "type": "article-journal", "title": "Spatial segregation of specialists and generalists in bird communities", "issue": "11", "author": [{"given": "Romain", "family": "Julliard"}, {"given": "Joanne", "family": "Clavel"}, {"given": "Vincent", "family": "Devictor"}, {"given": "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric", "family": "Jiguet"}, {"given": "Denis", "family": "Couvet"}], "abstract": "Each species generally has a close relationship with one or more habitats and can therefore be classified as either specialist or generalist. We studied whether specialist and generalist species are spatially distributed independently of each other. Repeating the analysis for 100 of the most frequent terrestrial bird species recorded over the 10 000 sampled sites of the French Breeding Bird survey, we found that specialists were more abundant if the rest of the community was specialized, and that the inverse was also true. This pattern was far subtler than just a simple dichotomy: most species actually presented a maximum abundance at a value of community specialization similar to their own level of specialization. Bird communities appear very well defined along a specialist\u2013 generalist gradient. We believe this pattern becomes more apparent with habitat degradation. The consequences on both ecological services and community resilience may well be considerable.", "volume": "9", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1461-0248.2006.00977.x", "page": "1237-1244", "issued": {"date-parts": [[2006]]}, "container-title": "Ecology Letters"}, {"id": "poi12c", "type": "article-journal", "title": "A comparative study of ecological specialization estimators", "issue": "3", "author": [{"given": "Timoth\u00e9e", "family": "Poisot"}, {"given": "Elsa", "family": "Canard"}, {"given": "Nicolas", "family": "Mouquet"}, {"given": "Michael E", "family": "Hochberg"}], "volume": "3", "DOI": "10.1111/j.2041-210X.2011.00174.x", "page": "537-544", "issued": {"date-parts": [[2012]]}, "container-title": "Methods in Ecology and Evolution"}, {"id": "vel10", "type": "article-journal", "title": "Conceptual synthesis in community ecology", "issue": "2", "author": [{"given": "Mark", "family": "Vellend"}], "keyword": "community, community ecology, conceptual synthesis, dispersal, drift, Ecology, population genetics, review, Selection, speciation", "abstract": "Community ecology is often perceived as a \u201cmess,\u201d given the seemingly vast number of processes that can underlie the many patterns of interest, and the apparent uniqueness of each study system. However, at the most general level, patterns in the composition and diversity of species\u2014the subject matter of community ecology\u2014are influenced by only four classes of process: selection, drift, speciation, and dispersal. Selection represents deterministic fitness differences among species, drift represents stochastic changes in species abundance, speciation creates new species, and dispersal is the movement of organisms across space. All theoretical and conceptual models in community ecology can be understood with respect to their emphasis on these four processes. Empirical evidence exists for all of these processes and many of their interactions, with a predominance of studies on selection. Organizing the material of community ecology according to this framework can clarify the essential similarities and differences among the many conceptual and theoretical approaches to the discipline, and it can also allow for the articulation of a very general theory of community dynamics: species are added to communities via speciation and dispersal, and the relative abundances of these species are then shaped by drift and selection, as well as ongoing dispersal, to drive community dynamics.", "volume": "85", "page": "183-206", "issued": {"date-parts": [[2010]]}, "container-title": "The Quarterly Review of Biology"}, {"id": "kol03", "type": "article-journal", "title": "Measuring beta diversity for presence-absence data", "issue": "3", "page": "367-382", "ISSN": "0021-8790", "volume": "72", "author": [{"given": "Patricia", "family": "Koleff"}, {"given": "Kevin J", "family": "Gaston"}, {"given": "Jack J", "family": "Lennon"}], "DOI": "10.1046/j.1365-2656.2003.00710.x", "URL": "http://doi.wiley.com/10.1046/j.1365-2656.2003.00710.x", "issued": {"date-parts": [[2003, 5]]}, "container-title": "Journal of Animal Ecology"}, {"id": "poi14", "type": "article-journal", "reference-count": 24, "ISSN": "2167-8359", "score": 1.0, "volume": "2", "DOI": "10.7717/peerj.251", "indexed": {"timestamp": 1400859403102, "date-parts": [[2014, 5, 23]]}, "source": "CrossRef", "deposited": {"timestamp": 1391472000000, "date-parts": [[2014, 2, 4]]}, "subtitle": [], "prefix": "http://id.crossref.org/prefix/10.7717", "publisher": "PeerJ", "title": "When is an ecological network complex?

Many anecdotes have been recounted, observations described and conclusions drawn about the negative impact of impact assessment on scientists and science. However, few of these accounts have drawn their conclusions from data, and those that have typically relied on a few studies. In this review, we present the most recent and pertinent data on the consequences that our current scholarly communication system has had on various measures of scientific quality (such as utility/citations, methodological soundness, expert ratings and retractions). These data confirm previous suspicions: using journal rank as an assessment tool is bad scientific practice. Moreover, the data lead us to argue that any journal rank (not only the currently-favored Impact Factor) would have this negative impact. Therefore, we suggest that abandoning journals altogether, in favor of a library-based scholarly communication system, will ultimately be necessary. This new system will use modern information technology to vastly improve the filter, sort and discovery function of the current journal system.", "URL": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3748", "issued": {"date-parts": [[2013, 1]]}, "container-title": "arXiv"}, {"id": "mcm12", "type": "article-journal", "title": "Plankton distribution and ocean dispersal", "issue": "Pt 6", "ISSN": "1477-9145", "keyword": "Aquatic Organisms, Models, Biological, movement, Oceans and Seas, plankton, Water Movements", "note": "PMID: 22357594", "abstract": "Plankton are small organisms that dwell in oceans, seas and bodies of fresh water. In this review, we discuss life in the plankton, which involves a balance between the behavioral capabilities of the organism and the characteristics and movement of the water that surrounds it. In order to consider this balance, we discuss how plankton interact with their environment across a range of scales - from the smallest viruses and bacteria to larger phytoplankton and zooplankton. We find that the larger scale distributions of plankton, observed in coastal waters, along continental shelves and in ocean basins, are highly dependent upon the smaller scale interactions between the individual organism and its environment. Further, we discuss how larger scale organism distributions may affect the transport and/or retention of plankton in the ocean environment. The research reviewed here provides a mechanistic understanding of how organism behavior in response to the physical environment produces planktonic aggregations, which has a direct impact on the way marine ecosystems function.", "volume": "215", "author": [{"given": "Margaret Anne", "family": "McManus"}, {"given": "C Brock", "family": "Woodson"}], "DOI": "10.1242/jeb.059014", "page": "1008-1016", "issued": {"date-parts": [[2012, 3]]}, "container-title": "The Journal of experimental biology"}, {"id": "des13", "type": "article-journal", "title": "The Case for Open Preprints in Biology", "accessed": {"date-parts": [[2013, 5, 14]]}, "author": [{"given": "Philippe", "family": "Desjardins-Proulx"}, {"given": "Ethan P.", "family": "White"}, {"given": "Joel J.", "family": "Adamson"}, {"given": "Karthik", "family": "Ram"}, {"given": "Timoth\u00e9e", "family": "Poisot"}, {"given": "Dominique", "family": "Gravel"}], "issue": "5", "container-title": "PLoS Biol", "abstract": "\\<p\\>Biologists should submit their preprints to open servers, a practice common in mathematics and physics, to open and accelerate the scientific process.\\</p\\>\\</sec\\>", "volume": "11", "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001563", "page": "e1001563", "issued": {"date-parts": [[2013]]}, "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pbio.1001563"}]
