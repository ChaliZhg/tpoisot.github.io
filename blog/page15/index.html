<h2>Using Color Brewer schemes in LaTeX pgfplots</h2>
<p class="meta">03 Jul 2012</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Color Brewer is an awesome project in which you can select color scales according to three kind of data you want to represent (diverging, sequential, qualitative). I use it in R all the time with the RColorBrewer package. Last week, I started using pgfplots, a tikz extension for data visualization, to prepare slides for the upcoming Evolution2012 meeting in Ottawa. I thought it would be pretty cool to be able to use the Color Brewer...<br />

<h2>Using networkx to simulate metapopulations in Python</h2>
<p class="meta">18 May 2012</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Python progressively replaced R for most of my daily simulations needs, because it’s relatively fast, easy to write, and a pleasure to read. There are a lot of great packages for scientists, and since I started working on food webs seriously, I’ve been using networkx more and more. We’ve been having discussions in the lab about spatial graphs, surrounding a recent paper by Gilarranz and Bascompte and some of our own projects, and I thought...<br />

<h2>The ecological journal of the future</h2>
<p class="meta">11 May 2012</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I’ve been reading Tim Gowers’s fascinating blog following the call to boycott Elsevier, and stumbled upon a fascinating gedankenexperiment. What would the electronic journal of the future look like in the field of Mathematics? Naturally, I found myself wondering, what would this next-generation journal look like in ecology, and how would it function on a daily basis? I have been thinking about this for the last few months (the earliest draft of this text dates...<br />

<h2>Phylogeny without a sequencer</h2>
<p class="meta">03 May 2012</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>In the last issue of Trends Ecol. Evol., Poole and colleagues talk about Ecosystomics, or the use of molecular data in ecology. If the subject is interesting to you, I recommend the reading of a recent paper by Nico Mouquet and colleagues about Ecophylogenetics. But I’m not going to discuss the science in these papers. Rather, I would like to share some methodological / technical insights related to these questions. At times, one would like...<br />

<h2>Ecology is not too collaborative</h2>
<p class="meta">30 Apr 2012</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>A few days ago, Jeremy Fox published on the Oikos blog, wondering if ecology was becoming too collaborative. The entry received a good number of comments, who mostly dealt with big, long terms collaborations. I can’t really talk for this kind of collaborations, having not been in the business of science for long enough. But I was surprized that small, one shot (or at least, short term) collaborations, were not mentionned. For what it’s worth,...<br />

<h2>Biblatex styles for ecology</h2>
<p class="meta">26 Apr 2012</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>A few months ago — when finishing to write my thesis, as I grew increasingly disatisfied by the clumsiness of natbib —, I started looking into biblatex. biblatex is essentially a re-implementation of LaTeX packages like cite, natbib, and others. And the more I used it, the more I realized two things. First, biblatex is awesome; it’s to natbib what knitr is to Sweave. Including the fact that switching from one system to the other...<br />
