<h2>A niche to fill in ecological publishing?</h2>
<p class="meta">23 Jun 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I have been wondering, over the past few weeks, about places to submit really short, methodological minded papers, in ecology. As far as I know, there is currently no journal for that. I’m specifically talking about papers that are not groundbreaking, possibly extremely technical, but still hold value because they deal with arguments that happen often. As a good example, the reply of Rohr and colleagues to the James and colleagues paper is interesting, but...<br />

<h2>A note on network complexity</h2>
<p class="meta">19 Jun 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I have seen the word complexity used to mean approximately anything in ecological network litterature, and to be extremely honest, I’m entirely guilty of that myself. We can probably find as many uses for complexity in the network litterature as there are uses for paradigm in Thomas Kuhn’s The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (which is to say, probbaly way too much, and certainly enough to confuse people). It’s getting bad enough that some of us...<br />

<h2>The structure of natural bacteria-phage networks</h2>
<p class="meta">30 May 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Freedom! The final chapter of my thesis is now online on the website of Ecological Processes. We use data form a field isolated bacteria-phage system to have a network approach of the specialist-generalist coexistence problem. The main result is that, even when controlling for phylogenetic dispersal of hosts, it’s better to be a generalist. This signal is highly consistent across the five networks we studied, and goes in the way of recent results on coevolution:...<br />

<h2>Measuring realized network modularity</h2>
<p class="meta">23 May 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>A paper describing how to measure realized network modularity just appeared online at F1000 Research. It’s currently waiting for reviewers. This is a short methodological note, to “solve” a problem I had when presenting the ouput of modularity analyses. Most of the time, the values you get are between 0 and 1, but they are fairly difficult to make sense of. They’re not probabilities that the network is different. They’re statistics to some extent, but...<br />

<h2>Trophic complementarity and the BEF relationship in food webs</h2>
<p class="meta">22 May 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I’m really glad to announce that we (here meaning Dom Gravel, Nicolas Mouquet and I), have a new paper in Ecology Letters, about the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationship in food webs. In this paper, we show that trophic complementarity is a very good predictor of productivity in complex ecosystems. You can go get the paper. So what is trophic complementarity, and why is this result important? The strength of the BEF theory is that the...<br />

<h2>Should code be reviewed?</h2>
<p class="meta">21 May 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Joppa and colleagues published a policy forum in Science, dealing with problems in the use of adoption of scientific software. Their paper quite nicely summarizes that the intrinsic quality of a software is not a deciding factor in its use, and that the community of scientists will be more influenced by who the early adopters are, and how well they are connected. In short, using a particular software quickly becomes a tradition, with few considerations...<br />
