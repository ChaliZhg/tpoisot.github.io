<h2>Writing grant applications can be fun</h2>
<p class="meta">04 Jan 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Most of my summer, and a substantial part of whatever time in fall was left after teaching, went into applying to various grants and positions. It’s a frustrating experience, because it’s time not spent doing research. But as I had no other possibility than doing it, I tried to make the experience enjoyable, and I even found myself learning a few things along the way. I’ve done my PhD in a French university, and it’s...<br />

<h2>Bacteria-phage networks</h2>
<p class="meta">19 Dec 2012</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I’m really glad to announce that the review paper we have been working on with Joshua Weitz, Justin Meyer, Cesar Flores, Sergi Valverde, Matthew Sullivan and Mike Hochberg is now online at Trends in Microbiology (PDF, as always, available by clicking Papers on the sidebar). It’s a great and exciting paper, in which we propose that bacteria-phage interactions should be studied as networks, rather than just pairs of interactions. Because the goal of the paper...<br />

<h2>The friends of my friends (are on twitter)</h2>
<p class="meta">15 Dec 2012</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Twitter is cool for science, because it can help you spread your ideas. And when you work with networks, Twitter is cool because it means a huge amount of data. With virtually no sampling effort. What has been said on the dynamics of, e.g., the Arab Spring, using social networks, was amazing, and I started developping a curiosity about what can be said about them with an ecological eye. I’m running pilots for a cool...<br />

<h2>How to represent networks</h2>
<p class="meta">23 Nov 2012</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>One big problem to people working with ecological networks is that most of the time, the data are not easy to get. Collections of food webs or mutualistic networks are passed from researcher to researcher, and it can be difficult to get your hands on a large database. Even if you have the data, you still have to put them in a “good” format, and it’s not always an easy task. It implies looping through...<br />

<h2>Data sharing and the bagel effect</h2>
<p class="meta">09 Nov 2012</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I’m starting to organize a collection of notes and ideas I’ve had over the last year into an opinion paper about data sharing in ecology. In a word, we should share our data, and we should do it in a technically sound way - I’ll tell more about these points later on. I was trying to illustrate the point that not sharing data is an absurdity, and to do so in a way that would...<br />

<h2>Should we care about species interaction networks?</h2>
<p class="meta">29 Oct 2012</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>In June, I was invited to give a talk at the Web of Life meeting in Montpellier. It was a really exciting event, where we discussed recent results on species interaction networks, and how we can use these networks to address the impact of global changes on communities and ecosystems. I presented some (still unpublished) results about how co-evolution and meta-community processes can lead to networks having a really complex structure. In parallel, I was...<br />
