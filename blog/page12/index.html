<h2>A selection of Sublime Text 2 packages</h2>
<p class="meta">22 Jan 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Sublime Text 2 is an awesome multi-purpose text editor, working on all major platforms, and generally being vim with a nice GUI, and some emacs thrown in for good measure. Over the last year, it has become my daily weapon of choice. As it offers a complete API, many people developed Python packages for it, and I use a few of them almost daily. Following some discussions we’ve had on twitter, I figured I’d share...<br />

<h2>If Elsevier acquires Mendeley, I'm out (and you should be too)</h2>
<p class="meta">19 Jan 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Two days ago, TechCrunch published an article saying that Elsevier was in “advanced talks” to acquire Mendeley. Why a company (Mendeley) whose goal is to help scientist work, and faciliate access to papers, would associate with a company so despised by so many researchers that they are actively and publicly boycotting it (Elsevier) makes absolutely no sense. Some people on the Mendeley advisors group wanted to know more, and here is the reply we got:...<br />

<h2>A quick way to get good figures for your web pages</h2>
<p class="meta">10 Jan 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I’m a huge fan of the pgfplots package for LaTeX, as it offers the possibility to include the source code of the figures directly within the document. It changed the way I organize my paper writing, as I now tipically have three sub-folders: notes, MS, and code. The results of what happens in code (usually a huge mess of R, C and Python) go directly into MS as tab-delimited files, and the .tex document has...<br />

<h2>INNGE announces EcoBloggers</h2>
<p class="meta">07 Jan 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>It all started with a rather enigmatic tweet, two weeks ago: Any ecologist with a blog, can you send me a message? @inngecologist is starting a cool project!&mdash; Tim (@tpoi) December 14, 2012 Thanks to Naupaka Zimmerman today is an important day, as INNGE launches EcoBloggers, a new platform to aggregate blog posts written by ecologists. Just this morning, there’s been some discussion at Dynamic Ecology that ecological blogs may be fading away. One of...<br />

<h2>Writing grant applications can be fun</h2>
<p class="meta">04 Jan 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Most of my summer, and a substantial part of whatever time in fall was left after teaching, went into applying to various grants and positions. It’s a frustrating experience, because it’s time not spent doing research. But as I had no other possibility than doing it, I tried to make the experience enjoyable, and I even found myself learning a few things along the way. I’ve done my PhD in a French university, and it’s...<br />

<h2>Bacteria-phage networks</h2>
<p class="meta">19 Dec 2012</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I’m really glad to announce that the review paper we have been working on with Joshua Weitz, Justin Meyer, Cesar Flores, Sergi Valverde, Matthew Sullivan and Mike Hochberg is now online at Trends in Microbiology (PDF, as always, available by clicking Papers on the sidebar). It’s a great and exciting paper, in which we propose that bacteria-phage interactions should be studied as networks, rather than just pairs of interactions. Because the goal of the paper...<br />
