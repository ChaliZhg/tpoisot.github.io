<h2>Are student-friendly conferences worth it?</h2>
<p class="meta">05 Aug 2012</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Two recent posts by Jeremy Fox and Zen Faulkes dealt with «students-friendly» conferences, and they do not seem too overtly enthusiastic about it, and prefer big meetings open to anyone. They have really valid points, which amount to the fact that there is no hierarchy in science, and anyone who wants to contribute a talk, or ask a question during a session, should feel free to do so. This is true. This is also not...<br />

<h2>My new linux setup</h2>
<p class="meta">03 Aug 2012</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I have a terrible confession to make. Two weeks ago, I installed Windows 7. Nobody was holding me at gunpoint. No member of my family was taken hostage by the IT people which were fed-up by our Mac rebellion. I took the rational, informed decision to install Windows 7 on a brand new machine. Why, oh why, do you ask? I made the switch from Mac to Linux, that’s why. I needed to install Windows...<br />

<h2>A walk on the intertidal zone</h2>
<p class="meta">15 Jul 2012</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I’m in the process of writing a big proposal about the complexity of species interaction networks, and how we need to account for multiple interaction types, spatial structure, and macro-ecology, to do better prediction of them. Then, yesterday, we went walking on the intertidal zone on the shore of the Saint-Lawrence. I saw this: What immediately came to my mind is: we don’t know anything. It’s one thing to look at species interaction networks, and...<br />

<h2>Using Color Brewer schemes in LaTeX pgfplots</h2>
<p class="meta">03 Jul 2012</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Color Brewer is an awesome project in which you can select color scales according to three kind of data you want to represent (diverging, sequential, qualitative). I use it in R all the time with the RColorBrewer package. Last week, I started using pgfplots, a tikz extension for data visualization, to prepare slides for the upcoming Evolution2012 meeting in Ottawa. I thought it would be pretty cool to be able to use the Color Brewer...<br />

<h2>Using networkx to simulate metapopulations in Python</h2>
<p class="meta">18 May 2012</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Python progressively replaced R for most of my daily simulations needs, because it’s relatively fast, easy to write, and a pleasure to read. There are a lot of great packages for scientists, and since I started working on food webs seriously, I’ve been using networkx more and more. We’ve been having discussions in the lab about spatial graphs, surrounding a recent paper by Gilarranz and Bascompte and some of our own projects, and I thought...<br />

<h2>The ecological journal of the future</h2>
<p class="meta">11 May 2012</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I’ve been reading Tim Gowers’s fascinating blog following the call to boycott Elsevier, and stumbled upon a fascinating gedankenexperiment. What would the electronic journal of the future look like in the field of Mathematics? Naturally, I found myself wondering, what would this next-generation journal look like in ecology, and how would it function on a daily basis? I have been thinking about this for the last few months (the earliest draft of this text dates...<br />
