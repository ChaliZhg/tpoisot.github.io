<h2>Notes on learning how to use sympy</h2>
<p class="meta">15 Aug 2012</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I’m trying to move to sympy for all my symbolic calculations. This post is just some notes taken during my first attempt, in which I’m playing with a simple host-parasite model. I was reading the First steps with sympy section of the website when I was running my little tests, and it’s relatively helpul. So let’s assume we have a classical host-parasite duo, with intra-specific host competition, and intrinsic mortality in the parasite. Its instantaneous...<br />

<h2>Models are useless. Real ecologists should move on.</h2>
<p class="meta">13 Aug 2012</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I’m spending more and more of my time doing theory related thing. Data analysis, model, drawing conceptual figures to make it seem like I have deep ideas about nature, life, and everything. Yet I love ecology, biology, and the complexity of natural systems. At this point, I’m sure most of you are familiar with the recent paper by Fawcett &amp; Higginson in PNAS - they conclude that the more equations are in a biology paper,...<br />

<h2>Are student-friendly conferences worth it?</h2>
<p class="meta">05 Aug 2012</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Two recent posts by Jeremy Fox and Zen Faulkes dealt with «students-friendly» conferences, and they do not seem too overtly enthusiastic about it, and prefer big meetings open to anyone. They have really valid points, which amount to the fact that there is no hierarchy in science, and anyone who wants to contribute a talk, or ask a question during a session, should feel free to do so. This is true. This is also not...<br />

<h2>My new linux setup</h2>
<p class="meta">03 Aug 2012</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I have a terrible confession to make. Two weeks ago, I installed Windows 7. Nobody was holding me at gunpoint. No member of my family was taken hostage by the IT people which were fed-up by our Mac rebellion. I took the rational, informed decision to install Windows 7 on a brand new machine. Why, oh why, do you ask? I made the switch from Mac to Linux, that’s why. I needed to install Windows...<br />

<h2>A walk on the intertidal zone</h2>
<p class="meta">15 Jul 2012</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I’m in the process of writing a big proposal about the complexity of species interaction networks, and how we need to account for multiple interaction types, spatial structure, and macro-ecology, to do better prediction of them. Then, yesterday, we went walking on the intertidal zone on the shore of the Saint-Lawrence. I saw this: What immediately came to my mind is: we don’t know anything. It’s one thing to look at species interaction networks, and...<br />

<h2>Using Color Brewer schemes in LaTeX pgfplots</h2>
<p class="meta">03 Jul 2012</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Color Brewer is an awesome project in which you can select color scales according to three kind of data you want to represent (diverging, sequential, qualitative). I use it in R all the time with the RColorBrewer package. Last week, I started using pgfplots, a tikz extension for data visualization, to prepare slides for the upcoming Evolution2012 meeting in Ottawa. I thought it would be pretty cool to be able to use the Color Brewer...<br />
