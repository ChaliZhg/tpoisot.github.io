	<div class='postinfo'>September 20, 2012</div>
	<p>Have you ever sampled interaction networks, and wished there were a good method to measure how dissimilar they are? Or have you ever thought about &beta;-diversity of species interactions? Do you just love good science? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you should read our Ecology Letters paper, now online. We propose a way to measure the &beta;-diversity of networks (any kind of network, unipartite, bipartite, quantitative, ...), and propose some ideas about what we can...</p>

	<p>I'm trying to move to sympy for all my symbolic calculations. This post is just some notes taken during my first attempt, in which I'm playing with a simple host-parasite model. I was reading the First steps with sympy section of the website when I was running my little tests, and it's relatively helpul. So let's assume we have a classical host-parasite duo, with intra-specific host competition, and intrinsic mortality in the parasite. Its instantaneous dynamics can be written as...</p>

	<p>Two recent posts by Jeremy Fox and Zen Faulkes dealt with «students-friendly» conferences, and they do not seem too overtly enthusiastic about it, and prefer big meetings open to anyone. They have really valid points, which amount to the fact that there is no hierarchy in science, and anyone who wants to contribute a talk, or ask a question during a session, should feel free to do so. This is true. This is also not how things work. When teaching,...</p>

No member of my family was taken hostage by the IT people which were fed-up by our Mac rebellion. I took the rational, informed decision to install Windows 7 on a brand new machine. Why, oh why, do you ask? I made the switch from Mac to Linux, that's why. I needed to install Windows on my new machine before...</p>

	<p>I'm in the process of writing a big proposal about the complexity of species interaction networks, and how we need to account for multiple interaction types, spatial structure, and macro-ecology, to do better prediction of them. Then, yesterday, we went walking on the intertidal zone on the shore of the Saint-Lawrence. I saw this: What immediately came to my mind is: we don't know anything. It's one thing to look at species interaction networks, and have a feeling that we...</p>

	<p>Color Brewer is an awesome project in which you can select color scales according to three kind of data you want to represent (diverging, sequential, qualitative). I use it in R all the time with the RColorBrewer package.

There are a lot of great packages for scientists, and since I started working on food webs seriously, I've been using networkx more and more. We've been having discussions in the lab about spatial graphs, surrounding a recent paper by Gilarranz and Bascompte and some of our own projects, and I thought that it will be fun...</p>

	<p>A few days ago, Jeremy Fox published on the Oikos blog, wondering if ecology was becoming too collaborative. The entry received a good number of comments, who mostly dealt with big, long terms collaborations. I can't really talk for this kind of collaborations, having not been in the business of science for long enough. But I was surprized that small, one shot (or at least, short term) collaborations, were not mentionned. For what it's worth, here is my contribution to...</p>

	<p>A few months ago — when finishing to write my thesis, as I grew increasingly disatisfied by the clumsiness of natbib —, I started looking into biblatex. biblatex is essentially a re-implementation of LaTeX packages like cite, natbib, and others. And the more I used it, the more I realized two things. First, biblatex is awesome; it's to natbib what knitr is to Sweave. Including the fact that switching from one system to the other is virtually transparent, but you...</p>

Specifically, most scientists are publicly stating that they will not review papers anymore, at least in the case of for-profit editors. Most...</p>
