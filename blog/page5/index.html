<h2>Mapping ecological concepts using twitter</h2>
<p class="meta">18 Oct 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I’ve been setting up a Twitter account for the French Ecological Society, and while we currently use it as a tool to relay the various informations we want to share, it’s also a great way to engage with people. So the question that immediately came to mind is: what kind of topics are associated with ecology on twitter? My own twitter list is a poor indicator of the “general public” as far as ecology is...<br />

<h2>An additive partition of species-level specificity</h2>
<p class="meta">15 Oct 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>A while ago, we published a paper in Methods in Ecology &amp; Evolution, comparing different ways to estimate ecological specificity on binary (presence/absence) and quantitative data. All the measures we review, and the one we introduce, work in the same way: for an organism, species, population, you have an array P of its performances across R different environments, which is (1) sorted decreasingly, and (2) ranged so that P[1] = 1. In this paper, we...<br />

<h2>R, priority effects, and the meta-package</h2>
<p class="meta">12 Oct 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>R packages are a superb opportunity to use new methods, and if anything, we should only rejoice that there are so many of them in ecology. Yet, there is a point that occurred to me over recent experiences (reviewing code for a few papers recently, and reading the help page about one of my own metrics in the bipartite package), and that I think is rarely discussed. When a R package presenting a series of...<br />

<h2>Inferring the structure of food webs</h2>
<p class="meta">21 Sep 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>We’ve just published a paper in Methods in Ecology and Evolution, about the inference of food web structure based on species trait data. That’s a seriously cool result (we think). There is a serious challenge when you work with food webs: you need to know which species are interacting, and to do so, you need to observed interactions in the fields. It’s challenging, because it must be done extensively, so as not to miss interactions....<br />

<h2>Is programming an acquired taste?</h2>
<p class="meta">11 Sep 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Two weeks ago, the whole lab headed up to a remote place in the Rimouski countryside for a summers school on Ecological Modeling. It was a whole lot of fun, and a really good way to get back to some things I’ve always wanted to study more in depth. So far, so good. Most of the days were courses in the morning, and programming in the afternoon. There were also some pen-and-paper model solving, but...<br />

<h2>Teach more maths to the undergrads!</h2>
<p class="meta">28 Aug 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Fred Barraquand, a bunch of INNGE-and-friends-of-INNGE people, and I, just published a preprint at Peer J about quantitative training in early-career ecologists (or rather, the lack thereof). Talking about how much maths is needed during training is all the rage in the ecological community, and both sides of the argument have really good arguments. So Fred decided to do a survey of early-career (and older) ecologists through ECOLOG-L. Quoting directly from the abstract, this is...<br />
