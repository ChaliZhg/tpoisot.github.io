	<h1 class='post-title'>Simulated phylogenetic trees and community assembly</h1>
	<div class='postinfo'>January  5, 2012</div>
	<p>I'm working on a toy model of community assembly in Python, and I thought it would be cool to have an easy way to keep track of the phylogeny. To do so, I've conceived two classes for the easy handling of phylogenetic structure. They are available on GitHub in the PyCoPhy repository (Python Community Phylogenetics), and check also the code page. The general idea behind them is quite easy to understand. A phylogenetic tree is a list of branchings. A...</p>

	<h1 class='post-title'>Goodbye Wordpress, hello Jekyll!</h1>
	<div class='postinfo'>January  1, 2012</div>
	<p>A few weeks ago, I discovered Jekyll. In a nutshell, Jekyll is a static site generator who promised me I'll be able to blog like a hacker. This site is now hosted on GitHub, and both the template and the content can be forked, so everything is basically open source. Jekyll is a lot of fun to use, especially because all of the content reside in static text files instead of a database. It's also fully compatible with the markdown...</p>

	<h1 class='post-title'>The aggregate function in Python</h1>
	<div class='postinfo'>December  1, 2011</div>
	<p>One thing I love the most about R is the aggregate function, which (in a nutshell) summarizes a data frame according to one or more columns, and perform some operations on the aggregated values. If, for example, you have a data frame with a treatment and a response, and want to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the response by level of treatment, then aggregate is usually the way to go. I wanted to do a quick plot with...</p>

	<div class='postinfo'>November 19, 2011</div>
	<p>More and more scientists are taking advantage of social networking tools to talk about their research. This trend was even deemed worthy of a paper in Nature this week. I've read this paper, and I had mixed feelings about it. On one hand, it was good to see the use of social medias showcased in such a prestigious journal. On the other hand, I felt it came out of nowhere, and was too descriptive. I was left wondering, if I...</p>

	<h1 class='post-title'>A model of population dynamics in Python</h1>
	<div class='postinfo'>November 14, 2011</div>
	<p>I've been using Python more and more to do various things. When compared to R (which I use a lot), Python is not more difficult to write, and a whole lot faster. I've started exploring tools to use Python for ecological simulations, and specifically the scipy library. In R, my usual tool is the simecol package, which implements a lot of numerical integrators, and most notably LSODA (which is awesome for many many reasons, including but not limited to its ability...</p>

	<div class='postinfo'>October 12, 2011</div>
	<p>The final paper of my master's project was published online today in PLoS One. It's about how species of a fish parasite, which were defined based on morphological features, may not be actual species, as they have no phylogenetic support. Lamellodiscus Johnston &amp; Tiegs 1922 (Monogenea, Diplectanidae) is a genus of common parasites on the gills of sparid fishes. Here we show that this genus is probably undergoing a fast molecular diversification, as reflected by the important genetic variability observed within...</p>

	<p>The INNGE network is now officially started, with a short Forum article in the INTECOL Bulletin (PDF attached at the end of this post). I'm obviously very glad to be part of this effort, which seeks to bring early career ecologists together from around the world, thereby strengthening international ties within a growing global community of ecologists. The Société Française d'Ecologie is supporting this initiative as well. If you want to know more about this network, or want to get...</p>

You can see them on Dailymotion (my own talk is not online yet). This seminar was organized by french PhD Students, in order to foster interactions between people working on experimental and theoretical aspects of the multiple fields that make evolutionary ecology. This year was our second attempt at organizing a seminar. For the first...</p>
