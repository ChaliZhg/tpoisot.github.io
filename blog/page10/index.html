<h2>Is E.O. Wilson wrong about maths?</h2>
<p class="meta">07 Apr 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>E.O. Wilson recently published an editorial entitled “Great scientists don’t need math” in the Wall Street Journal. Jeremy Fox wrote a great rebuttal of it, which you should certainly read as well. In short, Wilson’s argument is that most of great science is the work of intuition. In Jean Cocteau’s words, science is the confirmation of instinct’s discoveries. And in this perspective, math literacy is not needed, because it’s only a boring formality, to confirm...<br />

<h2>High-throughput sequencing and community ecology</h2>
<p class="meta">12 Mar 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>High-throughput sequencing (let’s abbreviate it as HTS), the ability to generate millions of sequences for a relatively low cost and effort, can make a huge difference in community ecology and biogeography. Think about it this way: for a few days of work, you can get a really exhaustive sampling of the diversity, with measures of relative abundance. I’m currently using 454 pyrosequencing in a project, and when I started reviewing the literature, I was stricken...<br />

<h2>A d3.js alternative to stacked bar charts</h2>
<p class="meta">18 Feb 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Following yesterday’s post on an alternative to barcharts, I decided to write an implementation of this graph in D3.js. The more I play around with it, the more I like it. As it turned out, it was fairly easy, so I’ll share the code as a gist. For this particular example, I assume that the data are in a matrix, in csv format, with sites as the first row, and species abundances in columns. I...<br />

<h2>An alternative to stacked bar charts</h2>
<p class="meta">17 Feb 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I hate stacked bar charts. I see them in so many papers, using the awful Excel default options, and I hate them. I feel them visually unappealing, confusing, and extremely inefficient at displaying information. It’s almost impossible to compare the size of two bars without measuring them, which means that they carry less information than a good old table. So I was looking for alternatives to them. Here is the code I ended up with....<br />

<h2>Estimating edges contribution to network properties</h2>
<p class="meta">13 Feb 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I had so much fun writing the previous post about how it is possible to measure nodes contribution to network properties that I wanted to see what happens when you remove edges. Also, I spent two hours this afternoon playing with D3.js, and I wanted to put what I’ve learnt in practice. What I want to do is remove each edge, and see how it affects modularity. This is, once again, really easy to do...<br />

<h2>Estimating node contribution to network properties</h2>
<p class="meta">12 Feb 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I’m currently exploring a large network dataset for a project, and one of the things I want to do is estimate the contribution of each node to emerging networks properties. For example, if your network has an important modularity, which nodes are the most responsible for it? I’ll just detail how it possible to get this information quickly using networkx. Warning! I'm just using this post to take notes on code I'm currently working on....<br />
