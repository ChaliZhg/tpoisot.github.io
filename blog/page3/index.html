<h2>Introducing mangal, a database for ecological networks</h2>
<p class="meta">07 Jan 2014</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Working with data on ecological networks is usually a huge mess. Most of the time, what you have is a series of matrices with 0 and 1, and in the best cases, another file with some associated metadata. The other issue is that, simply put, data on ecological networks are hard to get. The Interaction Web Database has some, but it’s not as actively maintained as it should, and the data are not standardized in...<br />

<h2>Understanding the variation of species interactions</h2>
<p class="meta">03 Jan 2014</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I spent most of the last two years thinking about why species interaction vary over time and space. The trouble is that, even though we have some methodological tools, and some interesting observations, we lack a solid framework to make sense of it all. So we (I, Daniel Stouffer and Dominique Gravel) started thinking about the mechanisms involved in the variation of species interactions. The paper is now available as a preprint on bioRxiV (the...<br />

<h2>Using git throughout your workflow</h2>
<p class="meta">02 Jan 2014</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>There are good chances that I will give an introductory workshop to the many, many uses of git for scientists in the next weeks. What follows is a series of notes about the things I use git for, which I will cover. In a way, this post is a list of all the possible ways to introduce git into your workflow as a (computational) scientist. Some things are specific to git as a protocol, some...<br />

<h2>Using Vim as a writing environment</h2>
<p class="meta">01 Jan 2014</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Happy new year, everyone! And to make sure it starts in a good way, let me bring you the gift of productivity! Or specifically, how to set-up Vim in a way that will transform it into an impressively efficient writing environment. Vim is a really good code editor, there is no questioning that. But writing code and writing prose are entirely different exercises, and some tools you need to efficiently write code are only getting...<br />

<h2>Software papers and open source licenses</h2>
<p class="meta">19 Dec 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I have been reviewing a lot more software / methodological papers these days, which led me to think about open vs. closed software (even more than usual). By closed, I mean any software that would require me to pay to be able to reproduce the method, either directly, or through a licence costing money to the university. Think Mathematica, matlab, or any other commercial tools. Despite what some would have you believe, the way analyses...<br />

<h2>What's hot on PeerJ?</h2>
<p class="meta">17 Dec 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Lat week, I mentionned that ecology is the leading discipline on PeerJ preprints, as attested by the number of submissions. Which led me to wondering which topics were actually hot on the preprint server. PeerJ do not have an API, but there URL scheme is not too complicated, and most of the relevant informations are in the webpage body. So I wrote a very short python script to get the first 158 preprints, download them,...<br />
