	<div class='postinfo'>February 12, 2013</div>
	<p>I'm currently exploring a large network dataset for a project, and one of the things I want to do is estimate the contribution of each node to emerging networks properties. For example, if your network has an important modularity, which nodes are the most responsible for it? I'll just detail how it possible to get this information quickly using networkx. Warning! I'm just using this post to take notes on code I'm currently working on. Saavedra et al. Nature 478...</p>

	<div class='postinfo'>February  8, 2013</div>
	<p>COinS is a specification to embed metadata in web pages. In short, when these data are present, most bibliography software are able to add the resource to your library. Having these data in blog posts can be good, because you can keep track of blog posts with your other references, but you can also formally cite blog posts in your papers (if some people can turn blog posts into TREE papers, citing blog posts might not be so far away)....</p>

	<p>Caroline Tucker and Marc Cadotte recently had a great blog post discussing the reinvention of the ecological wheel, with special mention of the biodiversity-ecosystem-functioning (BEF) literature. I read this blog post with a lot of interest, for reasons that I will mention in a later post. The basic issue was that: Some of the findings in the BEF literature could be criticized as simply being rediscoveries of classical theory and experimental evidence already in existence. I'll keep my opinion about...</p>

	<p>This fall, I gave a series of lectures in Population and Community Biology, for a group of 52 undergrads. I really love teaching, and having my own course to give all by myself is a blast. But it's a lecture, and as a student, I was not a big fan of them. Not enough interaction. You learn more by interacting than by listening, and even though it's possible to do participative lectures, it's hard; at least I think it is,...</p>

	<p>Jeremy Fox offers some advice about how to decide where to submit your paper. Also, read the response by Ethan White. There are possibly as many perspectives on this are there are researchers, which I'll definitely take as an excuse to present mine. Aim as high as you reasonably can. Then submit a step higher than that. I've had really good surprizes with papers being accepted in journals I would have considered too high (speaking purely in term of impact...</p>

	<p>Sublime Text 2 is an awesome multi-purpose text editor, working on all major platforms, and generally being vim with a nice GUI, and some emacs thrown in for good measure.

	<p>Two days ago, TechCrunch published an article saying that Elsevier was in "advanced talks" to acquire Mendeley. Why a company (Mendeley) whose goal is to help scientist work, and faciliate access to papers, would associate with a company so despised by so many researchers that they are actively and publicly boycotting it (Elsevier) makes absolutely no sense. Some people on the Mendeley advisors group wanted to know more, and here is the reply we got: So it seemed like there...</p>

It changed the way I organize my paper writing, as I now tipically have three sub-folders: notes, MS, and code. The results of what happens in code (usually a huge mess of R, C and Python) go directly into MS as tab-delimited files, and the .tex document has all the commands needed to...</p>

	<p>Most of my summer, and a substantial part of whatever time in fall was left after teaching, went into applying to various grants and positions. It's a frustrating experience, because it's time not spent doing research. But as I had no other possibility than doing it, I tried to make the experience enjoyable, and I even found myself learning a few things along the way. I've done my PhD in a French university, and it's very different from what happens...</p>

	<p>Twitter is cool for science, because it can help you spread your ideas. And when you work with networks, Twitter is cool because it means a huge amount of data. With virtually no sampling effort. What has been said on the dynamics of, e.g., the Arab Spring, using social networks, was amazing, and I started developping a curiosity about what can be said about them with an ecological eye. I'm running pilots for a cool side project involving this kind...</p>

	<div class='postinfo'>November 23, 2012</div>
	<p>One big problem to people working with ecological networks is that most of the time, the data are not easy to get. Collections of food webs or mutualistic networks are passed from researcher to researcher, and it can be difficult to get your hands on a large database. Even if you have the data, you still have to put them in a "good" format, and it's not always an easy task. It implies looping through text files, putting the webs...</p>

I was trying to illustrate the point that not sharing data is an absurdity, and to do so in a way that would be appealing to people. Let's...</p>
