	<h1 class='post-title'>Is programming an acquired taste?</h1>
	<div class='postinfo'>September 11, 2013</div>
	<p>Two weeks ago, the whole lab headed up to a remote place in the Rimouski countryside for a summers school on Ecological Modeling. It was a whole lot of fun, and a really good way to get back to some things I've always wanted to study more in depth. So far, so good. Most of the days were courses in the morning, and programming in the afternoon. There were also some pen-and-paper model solving, but I won't talk much about...</p>

	<p>Fred Barraquand, a bunch of INNGE-and-friends-of-INNGE people, and I, just published a preprint at Peer J about quantitative training in early-career ecologists (or rather, the lack thereof). Talking about how much maths is needed during training is all the rage in the ecological community, and both sides of the argument have really good arguments. So Fred decided to do a survey of early-career (and older) ecologists through ECOLOG-L. Quoting directly from the abstract, this is what we found: We found...</p>

	<p>Early in July, Christopher Lortie published a really great preprint on PeerJ, about the opportunities of systematic reviews for ecology. It's extremely insightful, and a good read. The abstract starts by Narrative reviews are dead. No they're not, nor shouldn't they be! Narrative reviews are those we are used to read now: a story built on the collection of some pieces of litterature. On the other hand, systematic reviews or meta-analyses are, well, systematic, and try to reach a consensus...</p>

	<p>We have a new paper online at Parasitology, on the differences of the structure between rodents hosts, and their obligates of facultatives parasites. We had data from a really cool rodents-ectoparasites system, in which the same hosts have both facultative and obligate parasites. These data were also collected in different locations, and at different times. There are two important things in the results. First, the networks of obligate and facultative parasites look nothing alike. One (obligate) is highly modular and...</p>

We'll send it up for review (at PeerJ also) in a while, but feel free to read it and give us feedback using the github issues tracker. We'd like that very much, actually. And as the github repository is public, feel free to fork/edit/push modifications if you have something to contribute to the paper. In a nutshell; we argue that...</p>

	<p>Hey, it's been a year since I switched to Linux. I've tried a few different distros, and finally settled on Arch Linux with OpenBox. It's ligthweight, uncluttered, and I love. But that's not what I'm going to talk about. I may have mentionned in the past that I used Sublime Text 2. During my quest for ever-increasing minimalism, I've made the switch to vim. And I now have a cool writing setup. Most of what I do is writing markdown...</p>

	<p>F1000Research just put up a new blog post to announce that they will concentrate some of their efforts to increase the proportion of ecology papers they publish. We should all be excited about this. First, the article processing fees will be waived until 2014, so here goes a good opportunity to see for yourself how this journal works. Second, the publication model of F1000Research is extremely interesting. After initial checking, the paper is put on-line, and appears as a preprint....</p>

I have stacks of datasets on my laptop, and good ecological questions to ask, and (hopefully) that will result in a few papers. But that's not fun. I know what I have to do, how I have to do it, and I'm mostly re-using existing tools. So over the last month or...</p>

Zotero stores the data about your library in a sqlite3 database, called zotero.sqlite, and stored in your Zotero folder (~/Zotero/ in my case, but most likely something else in yours). The internal structure of the database is very weird, and it took my a bit of poking around in sqliteman to figure it out. But in the end, I was able to come up with a solution to...</p>

It was not the first time it happenned, and always on journals using manuscriptcentral as an upload system, and always with LaTeX-generated PDF. My previous fix for this, in the proud quick-and-dirty tradition of the academic world, was to (1) import the PDF in google documents, (2) print it as a PDF, (3) upload the PDF and (4) drink the shame away.

	<p>I have been wondering, over the past few weeks, about places to submit really short, methodological minded papers, in ecology. As far as I know, there is currently no journal for that. I'm specifically talking about papers that are not groundbreaking, possibly extremely technical, but still hold value because they deal with arguments that happen often. As a good example, the reply of Rohr and colleagues to the James and colleagues paper is interesting, but technical. It's unlikely to stimulate...</p>

	<div class='postinfo'>June 19, 2013</div>
	<p>I have seen the word complexity used to mean approximately anything in ecological network litterature, and to be extremely honest, I'm entirely guilty of that myself. We can probably find as many uses for complexity in the network litterature as there are uses for paradigm in Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (which is to say, probbaly way too much, and certainly enough to confuse people). It's getting bad enough that some of us (and again, I'm probably guilty...</p>

	<p>Freedom! The final chapter of my thesis is now online on the website of Ecological Processes. We use data form a field isolated bacteria-phage system to have a network approach of the specialist-generalist coexistence problem. The main result is that, even when controlling for phylogenetic dispersal of hosts, it's better to be a generalist. This signal is highly consistent across the five networks we studied, and goes in the way of recent results on coevolution: if you let a system...</p>
