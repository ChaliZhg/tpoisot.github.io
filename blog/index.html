    <p>I have seen the word complexity used to mean approximately anything in ecological network litterature, and to be extremely honest, I'm entirely guilty of that myself. We can probably find as many uses for complexity in the network litterature as there are uses for paradigm in Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (which is to say, probbaly way too much, and certainly enough to confuse people). It's getting bad enough that some of us (and again, I'm probably guilty... <a href="/2013/06/19/notes-on-network-complexity/" class='postinfo'>Keep on reading!</a></p>

    <p>Freedom! The final chapter of my thesis is now online on the website of Ecological Processes. We use data form a field isolated bacteria-phage system to have a network approach of the specialist-generalist coexistence problem. The main result is that, even when controlling for phylogenetic dispersal of hosts, it's better to be a generalist. This signal is highly consistent across the five networks we studied, and goes in the way of recent results on coevolution: if you let a system... <a href="/2013/05/30/bacteria-soil-networks/" class='postinfo'>Keep on reading!</a></p>

This is a short methodological note, to "solve" a problem I had when presenting the ouput of modularity analyses. Most of the time, the values you get are between 0 and 1, but they are fairly difficult to make sense of. They're not probabilities that the network is different.

In this paper, we show that trophic complementarity is a very good predictor of productivity in complex ecosystems. You can go get the paper. So what is trophic complementarity, and why is this result important?

It may not sound like it, but it's kind of a big deal when measuring similarity between sequences, most likely when you try to do taxonomic identification by comparing to the best match of blast.

In Jean Cocteau's words, science is the confirmation of instinct's discoveries.

    <p>A few days ago, Jeremy Fox published on the Oikos blog, wondering if ecology was becoming too collaborative. The entry received a good number of comments, who mostly dealt with big, long terms collaborations. I can't really talk for this kind of collaborations, having not been in the business of science for long enough. But I was surprized that small, one shot (or at least, short term) collaborations, were not mentionned. For what it's worth, here is my contribution to... <a href="/2012/04/30/ecology-not-too-collaborative/" class='postinfo'>Keep on reading!</a></p>

    <p>A few months ago — when finishing to write my thesis, as I grew increasingly disatisfied by the clumsiness of natbib —, I started looking into biblatex. biblatex is essentially a re-implementation of LaTeX packages like cite, natbib, and others. And the more I used it, the more I realized two things. First, biblatex is awesome; it's to natbib what knitr is to Sweave. Including the fact that switching from one system to the other is virtually transparent, but you... <a href="/2012/04/26/biblatex-styles-ecology/" class='postinfo'>Keep on reading!</a></p>

    <p>So it seems that the love/hate relationship between science and publishers has reached its tipping point following the RWA turmoil, with appeals to boycott major publishers, such as researchwithoutwalls and thecostofknowledge, and some of the most eminents members of the scientific blogosphere talking about it, and using creative metaphors to illustrate how big of a scam it is. Specifically, most scientists are publicly stating that they will not review papers anymore, at least in the case of for-profit editors.

Not only it allowed me to have a backup of my chapters somewhere else than on my hard drive, but I could also revert back to a previous version of some paragraphs I liked better.

    <p>I'm working on a toy model of community assembly in Python, and I thought it would be cool to have an easy way to keep track of the phylogeny. To do so, I've conceived two classes for the easy handling of phylogenetic structure. They are available on GitHub in the PyCoPhy repository (Python Community Phylogenetics), and check also the code page. The general idea behind them is quite easy to understand. A phylogenetic tree is a list of branchings. A... <a href="/2012/01/05/a-python-class-for-phylogenies/" class='postinfo'>Keep on reading!</a></p>

This site is now hosted on GitHub, and both the template and the content can be forked, so everything is basically open source.

If, for example, you have a data frame with a treatment and a response, and want to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the response by level of treatment, then aggregate is usually the way to go.

    <p>The final paper of my master's project was published online today in PLoS One. It's about how species of a fish parasite, which were defined based on morphological features, may not be actual species, as they have no phylogenetic support. Lamellodiscus Johnston &amp; Tiegs 1922 (Monogenea, Diplectanidae) is a genus of common parasites on the gills of sparid fishes. Here we show that this genus is probably undergoing a fast molecular diversification, as reflected by the important genetic variability observed within... <a href="/2011/10/12/morpho-phylo-lamellodiscus/" class='postinfo'>Keep on reading!</a></p>
