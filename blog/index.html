<h2>Don't be afraid of Open Access</h2>
<p class="meta">24 Mar 2014</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>This post is a copy of a response Karthik Ram and I wrote to a recent paper in Trends in Plant Science, criticizing Open Access as being risky, especially to early career people. Stephen Curry wrote a great reply. Our paper never made it past the editor, so I reproduce it here. In a recent Letter, Agrawal (2014) raises four points for which scientists should be skeptical of the Open Access (OA) movement, two of...<br />

<h2>Teaching isoclines in the two-species competitive logistic model</h2>
<p class="meta">18 Mar 2014</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I’ve had a great discussion by email with Crystal Ernst, about the best way to teach isoclines and phase portraits to undergraduates. I had this discussion countless times over the last two years, and I struggled when I had to teach that myself. I ended up finding a little twist on the classical diagrams, and so I decided that it was time to share it. Isoclines are usually first introduced when discussing the logistic model...<br />

<h2>Is a citation a missed publication?</h2>
<p class="meta">07 Mar 2014</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I had a very interesting discussion/argument on twitter this afternoon, about (basically) why data sharing is evil. Or to put it in a more balanced way, why sharing data is a net loss of potential papers for people. Because 140 characters are not enough to make a coherent argument, I will summarize my position here. The key disagreement with coercive data sharing policies is that journals are requiring people to give away their data, and...<br />

<h2>Ecologists needs to focus more on patterns</h2>
<p class="meta">05 Mar 2014</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Ecology is the study, which is to say the identification, description, and reporting, of patterns. Patterns are simply defined as there being something rather than nothing, which is to say something that can represented as a histogram or a scatterplot, or even just called a pattern because this helps relate it to previously described patterns. Sub-fields of ecology are primarily defined by which types of patterns they look for. Functional ecologists are interested in traits...<br />

<h2>Of the value of datasets and methods in open science</h2>
<p class="meta">04 Mar 2014</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>The interesting thing about predictions is that sometimes, they come true. Last week, I was discussing the need to do advocacy about open data; specifically, the need to do it fast, because one day, a big journal will release a new policy, and we are going to see the closest thing to mass hysteria that the academic world can do. If I was so good at predicting species interactions, I’d be a much happier ecologist....<br />

<h2>Responsibility and sensationalism in high-profile papers</h2>
<p class="meta">25 Jan 2014</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Last week, we had an inter-lab journal club during which we discussed a very polemic paper in ecology. The discussion quickly turned into the responsibility of people at the various levels of the scientific publishing process, and the risks associated with counter-mainstream results appearing in high-profile journals. Most of what follows is my recollection of the different arguments we raised for and against self-censorship in scientific publishing. Which paper we discussed is not relevant for...<br />
