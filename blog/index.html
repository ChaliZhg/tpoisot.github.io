<h2>Of the value of datasets and methods in open science</h2>
<p class="meta">04 Mar 2014</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>The interesting thing about predictions is that sometimes, they come true. Last week, I was discussing the need to do advocacy about open data; specifically, the need to do it fast, because one day, a big journal will release a new policy, and we are going to see the closest thing to mass hysteria that the academic world can do. If I was so good at predicting species interactions, I’d be a much happier ecologist....<br />

<h2>My worst experience as a teacher</h2>
<p class="meta">21 Feb 2014</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>The other day, I was part of a short discussion about our worst teaching experiences. I was wondering between the time a first-year student set its bench and lab report on fire (albeit for a short time, for ethanol is a good combustible), and the time a second year student told me I should cut the class on classical population dynamics models, because what is the point of that for ecologists? Then a few days...<br />

<h2>Be nice to students</h2>
<p class="meta">20 Feb 2014</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>You will never do research. You may work as a lab tech, but being a researcher is out of the question for you. Trust me. I have been told this exact thing by a well known, well published, highly respected scientist (whose identity is not important) at the end of my Bachelor’s degree. I’m certainly glad I didn’t trust him. I’m glad I found people that gave me the opportunity (and training, because Oh boy...<br />

<h2>Responsibility and sensationalism in high-profile papers</h2>
<p class="meta">25 Jan 2014</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Last week, we had an inter-lab journal club during which we discussed a very polemic paper in ecology. The discussion quickly turned into the responsibility of people at the various levels of the scientific publishing process, and the risks associated with counter-mainstream results appearing in high-profile journals. Most of what follows is my recollection of the different arguments we raised for and against self-censorship in scientific publishing. Which paper we discussed is not relevant for...<br />

<h2>Should we tell students that communities don't exist?</h2>
<p class="meta">21 Jan 2014</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Literally one of the first things I told my students in the first lecture of the Population and Community Dynamics class I gave last winter was along the lines of an ecological community is the pool of all species occuring at the same place and at the same time (and the interactions between them). This is more or a less a synthesis of what you can find in the first pages of Peter Morin’s textbook,...<br />
