<h2>Steal my paper! (seriously, please, don't)</h2>
<p class="meta">16 May 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>With Phil’s paper on preprints out, and the idea that writing manuscripts in the open introduced by Karthik Ram, it’s almost not completely crazy to write research papers in an entirely open space, like github or Google Docs. I’m currently doing it (everything with paper or ms in the title of the repository is something not yet published), and so are a few other people. And it’s a good thing. It might actually be the...<br />

<h2>A C version of the Nicholson-Bailey model</h2>
<p class="meta">06 May 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>The Nicholson-Bailey model is a well known model of host and parasitoid population dynamics. It assumes that parasitoids will search a fraction of their habitat for hosts, and then kill them. Yes, it’s brutal like that. There are a few fun things with this model. It’s light in parameters (the single-patch version requires only three parameters), it’s in discrete time (so it’s easy to program), and it’s classical put on a lattice (so it’s a...<br />

<h2>Data sharing and preprints in ecology</h2>
<p class="meta">30 Apr 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I’m glad to announce that we (I, Ross Mounce, and Dom Gravel), have put up a preprint about data sharing in ecology on figshare. The manuscript is under consideration at Ideas in Ecology &amp; Evolution. We try to make a valid point about why ecologists should share their data, how we can do it in practice, and the role that funding agencies and journals can play. And speaking of preprints, but also sure to check...<br />

<h2>Learning how to code (in ecology)</h2>
<p class="meta">12 Apr 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>A few days ago, I received an email asking about pointers on how to program in ecology. I’m not sure I’m the best person to ask, but writing the answer, I realized that there might be potential to share tips with other people. Now, a little bit of foreword. I come from a very empirical background. My undergrad studies are in genetics and immunology, and up until the end of my Masters, I have been...<br />

<h2>Elsevier acquired Mendeley. It's not as bad as I thought.</h2>
<p class="meta">09 Apr 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Mendeley was recently acquired by public enemy Elsevier in a puzzling move. Some of you may remember that I’ve announced that, should this acquisition happen, I’ll be out of here. Actually, I’ve switched to Zotero a while back and never ever looked back. But still. Mr. Will Gunn himself asked me to do a follow-up post, on the basis that it’s not as bad as I feared. And as much as I am pained to...<br />

<h2>Is E.O. Wilson wrong about maths?</h2>
<p class="meta">07 Apr 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>E.O. Wilson recently published an editorial entitled “Great scientists don’t need math” in the Wall Street Journal. Jeremy Fox wrote a great rebuttal of it, which you should certainly read as well. In short, Wilson’s argument is that most of great science is the work of intuition. In Jean Cocteau’s words, science is the confirmation of instinct’s discoveries. And in this perspective, math literacy is not needed, because it’s only a boring formality, to confirm...<br />
