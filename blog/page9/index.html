<h2>Should code be reviewed?</h2>
<p class="meta">21 May 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Joppa and colleagues published a policy forum in Science, dealing with problems in the use of adoption of scientific software. Their paper quite nicely summarizes that the intrinsic quality of a software is not a deciding factor in its use, and that the community of scientists will be more influenced by who the early adopters are, and how well they are connected. In short, using a particular software quickly becomes a tradition, with few considerations...<br />

<h2>Remove indels from blast output</h2>
<p class="meta">20 May 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>My wife recently mentionned to me that most of the errors introduced during 454 pyrosequencing were indels rather than point mutations. It may not sound like it, but it’s kind of a big deal when measuring similarity between sequences, most likely when you try to do taxonomic identification by comparing to the best match of blast. So to get a “reliable” estimate of the dissimilarity, a reliable strategy is most likely to remove the gaps....<br />

<h2>Using make and pandoc for reproducible papers</h2>
<p class="meta">18 May 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I tend to use pandoc more and more to write my papers. The syntax of markdown is ligthweight, doesn’t get in the way of my writing, and it’s easy to export the text to almost any format you can name afterward. The only issue I ran in is that I also like pgfplots a lot for graphics, because they come with the ability to update themselves at each compilation, when the data are re-generated. It’s...<br />

<h2>Steal my paper! (seriously, please, don't)</h2>
<p class="meta">16 May 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>With Phil’s paper on preprints out, and the idea that writing manuscripts in the open introduced by Karthik Ram, it’s almost not completely crazy to write research papers in an entirely open space, like github or Google Docs. I’m currently doing it (everything with paper or ms in the title of the repository is something not yet published), and so are a few other people. And it’s a good thing. It might actually be the...<br />

<h2>A C version of the Nicholson-Bailey model</h2>
<p class="meta">06 May 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>The Nicholson-Bailey model is a well known model of host and parasitoid population dynamics. It assumes that parasitoids will search a fraction of their habitat for hosts, and then kill them. Yes, it’s brutal like that. There are a few fun things with this model. It’s light in parameters (the single-patch version requires only three parameters), it’s in discrete time (so it’s easy to program), and it’s classical put on a lattice (so it’s a...<br />

<h2>Data sharing and preprints in ecology</h2>
<p class="meta">30 Apr 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I’m glad to announce that we (I, Ross Mounce, and Dom Gravel), have put up a preprint about data sharing in ecology on figshare. The manuscript is under consideration at Ideas in Ecology &amp; Evolution. We try to make a valid point about why ecologists should share their data, how we can do it in practice, and the role that funding agencies and journals can play. And speaking of preprints, but also sure to check...<br />
