<h2>What do I read (according to Zotero)?</h2>
<p class="meta">09 Jul 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I’ve been playing around a bit with Zotero these last few days. Zotero stores the data about your library in a sqlite3 database, called zotero.sqlite, and stored in your Zotero folder (~/Zotero/ in my case, but most likely something else in yours). The internal structure of the database is very weird, and it took my a bit of poking around in sqliteman to figure it out. But in the end, I was able to come...<br />

<h2>A quick way to parallelize</h2>
<p class="meta">08 Jul 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I’ ve often been confronted to the situation when I want to run a bunch of simulations, that will take long if I run them in batch, but long enough that I want to put them on the lab cluster. A fairly common situation is when I want to feed some sequentially numbered output files to a script performing all kind of black magic (a.k.a. data analysis). While looking for a solution, I came across...<br />

<h2>Fixes for the ManuscriptCentral PDF conversion problem</h2>
<p class="meta">24 Jun 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>While submitting a MS to Methods in Ecology and Evolution, I ran into a PDF conversion problem. It was not the first time it happenned, and always on journals using manuscriptcentral as an upload system, and always with LaTeX-generated PDF. My previous fix for this, in the proud quick-and-dirty tradition of the academic world, was to (1) import the PDF in google documents, (2) print it as a PDF, (3) upload the PDF and (4)...<br />

<h2>A niche to fill in ecological publishing?</h2>
<p class="meta">23 Jun 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I have been wondering, over the past few weeks, about places to submit really short, methodological minded papers, in ecology. As far as I know, there is currently no journal for that. I’m specifically talking about papers that are not groundbreaking, possibly extremely technical, but still hold value because they deal with arguments that happen often. As a good example, the reply of Rohr and colleagues to the James and colleagues paper is interesting, but...<br />

<h2>A note on network complexity</h2>
<p class="meta">19 Jun 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I have seen the word complexity used to mean approximately anything in ecological network litterature, and to be extremely honest, I’m entirely guilty of that myself. We can probably find as many uses for complexity in the network litterature as there are uses for paradigm in Thomas Kuhn’s The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (which is to say, probbaly way too much, and certainly enough to confuse people). It’s getting bad enough that some of us...<br />

<h2>The structure of natural bacteria-phage networks</h2>
<p class="meta">30 May 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Freedom! The final chapter of my thesis is now online on the website of Ecological Processes. We use data form a field isolated bacteria-phage system to have a network approach of the specialist-generalist coexistence problem. The main result is that, even when controlling for phylogenetic dispersal of hosts, it’s better to be a generalist. This signal is highly consistent across the five networks we studied, and goes in the way of recent results on coevolution:...<br />
