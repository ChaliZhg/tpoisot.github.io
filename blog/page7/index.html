<h2>F1000Research announces new Ecology section</h2>
<p class="meta">08 Aug 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>F1000Research just put up a new blog post to announce that they will concentrate some of their efforts to increase the proportion of ecology papers they publish. We should all be excited about this. First, the article processing fees will be waived until 2014, so here goes a good opportunity to see for yourself how this journal works. Second, the publication model of F1000Research is extremely interesting. After initial checking, the paper is put on-line,...<br />

<h2>Codelust</h2>
<p class="meta">05 Aug 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Wanderlust (noun): a strong desire to travel. Codelust (noun): a strong desire to code rather than actually work, and how you can use it for good. I’m lucky. I have stacks of datasets on my laptop, and good ecological questions to ask, and (hopefully) that will result in a few papers. But that’s not fun. I know what I have to do, how I have to do it, and I’m mostly re-using existing tools. So...<br />

<h2>Should we share reviews?</h2>
<p class="meta">10 Jul 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Britt Koskella uploaded reviews, and her replies, for her recent Current Biology paper (which, by the way, is great). She also announced that she will do the same thing every time a paper is published. We’ve had a discussion in the lab over the few months, about whether or not we should do almost the same thing: we wanted to put online a very tongue-in-cheek Hall of fame of the “worse” comments we’ve received, for...<br />

<h2>What do I read (according to Zotero)?</h2>
<p class="meta">09 Jul 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I’ve been playing around a bit with Zotero these last few days. Zotero stores the data about your library in a sqlite3 database, called zotero.sqlite, and stored in your Zotero folder (~/Zotero/ in my case, but most likely something else in yours). The internal structure of the database is very weird, and it took my a bit of poking around in sqliteman to figure it out. But in the end, I was able to come...<br />

<h2>A quick way to parallelize</h2>
<p class="meta">08 Jul 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I’ ve often been confronted to the situation when I want to run a bunch of simulations, that will take long if I run them in batch, but long enough that I want to put them on the lab cluster. A fairly common situation is when I want to feed some sequentially numbered output files to a script performing all kind of black magic (a.k.a. data analysis). While looking for a solution, I came across...<br />

<h2>Fixes for the ManuscriptCentral PDF conversion problem</h2>
<p class="meta">24 Jun 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>While submitting a MS to Methods in Ecology and Evolution, I ran into a PDF conversion problem. It was not the first time it happenned, and always on journals using manuscriptcentral as an upload system, and always with LaTeX-generated PDF. My previous fix for this, in the proud quick-and-dirty tradition of the academic world, was to (1) import the PDF in google documents, (2) print it as a PDF, (3) upload the PDF and (4)...<br />
