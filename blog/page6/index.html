<h2>In defense of narrative reviews</h2>
<p class="meta">24 Aug 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Early in July, Christopher Lortie published a really great preprint on PeerJ, about the opportunities of systematic reviews for ecology. It’s extremely insightful, and a good read. The abstract starts by Narrative reviews are dead. No they’re not, nor shouldn’t they be! Narrative reviews are those we are used to read now: a story built on the collection of some pieces of litterature. On the other hand, systematic reviews or meta-analyses are, well, systematic, and...<br />

<h2>Network structure of obligate and facultative parasites</h2>
<p class="meta">20 Aug 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>We have a new paper online at Parasitology, on the differences of the structure between rodents hosts, and their obligates of facultatives parasites. We had data from a really cool rodents-ectoparasites system, in which the same hosts have both facultative and obligate parasites. These data were also collected in different locations, and at different times. There are two important things in the results. First, the networks of obligate and facultative parasites look nothing alike. One...<br />

<h2>Complexity and connectance of ecological networks</h2>
<p class="meta">19 Aug 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>So my blog post on ecological complexity in networks turned into a manuscript, now online as a preprint at PeerJ. We’ll send it up for review (at PeerJ also) in a while, but feel free to read it and give us feedback using the github issues tracker. We’d like that very much, actually. And as the github repository is public, feel free to fork/edit/push modifications if you have something to contribute to the paper. In...<br />

<h2>Writing manuscripts in Linux (like a boss)</h2>
<p class="meta">18 Aug 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Hey, it’s been a year since I switched to Linux. I’ve tried a few different distros, and finally settled on Arch Linux with OpenBox. It’s ligthweight, uncluttered, and I love. But that’s not what I’m going to talk about. I may have mentionned in the past that I used Sublime Text 2. During my quest for ever-increasing minimalism, I’ve made the switch to vim. And I now have a cool writing setup. Most of what...<br />

<h2>F1000Research announces new Ecology section</h2>
<p class="meta">08 Aug 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>F1000Research just put up a new blog post to announce that they will concentrate some of their efforts to increase the proportion of ecology papers they publish. We should all be excited about this. First, the article processing fees will be waived until 2014, so here goes a good opportunity to see for yourself how this journal works. Second, the publication model of F1000Research is extremely interesting. After initial checking, the paper is put on-line,...<br />

<h2>Codelust</h2>
<p class="meta">05 Aug 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Wanderlust (noun): a strong desire to travel. Codelust (noun): a strong desire to code rather than actually work, and how you can use it for good. I’m lucky. I have stacks of datasets on my laptop, and good ecological questions to ask, and (hopefully) that will result in a few papers. But that’s not fun. I know what I have to do, how I have to do it, and I’m mostly re-using existing tools. So...<br />
