<h2>Inferring the structure of food webs</h2>
<p class="meta">21 Sep 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>We’ve just published a paper in Methods in Ecology and Evolution, about the inference of food web structure based on species trait data. That’s a seriously cool result (we think). There is a serious challenge when you work with food webs: you need to know which species are interacting, and to do so, you need to observed interactions in the fields. It’s challenging, because it must be done extensively, so as not to miss interactions....<br />

<h2>Is programming an acquired taste?</h2>
<p class="meta">11 Sep 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Two weeks ago, the whole lab headed up to a remote place in the Rimouski countryside for a summers school on Ecological Modeling. It was a whole lot of fun, and a really good way to get back to some things I’ve always wanted to study more in depth. So far, so good. Most of the days were courses in the morning, and programming in the afternoon. There were also some pen-and-paper model solving, but...<br />

<h2>Teach more maths to the undergrads!</h2>
<p class="meta">28 Aug 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Fred Barraquand, a bunch of INNGE-and-friends-of-INNGE people, and I, just published a preprint at Peer J about quantitative training in early-career ecologists (or rather, the lack thereof). Talking about how much maths is needed during training is all the rage in the ecological community, and both sides of the argument have really good arguments. So Fred decided to do a survey of early-career (and older) ecologists through ECOLOG-L. Quoting directly from the abstract, this is...<br />

<h2>In defense of narrative reviews</h2>
<p class="meta">24 Aug 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Early in July, Christopher Lortie published a really great preprint on PeerJ, about the opportunities of systematic reviews for ecology. It’s extremely insightful, and a good read. The abstract starts by Narrative reviews are dead. No they’re not, nor shouldn’t they be! Narrative reviews are those we are used to read now: a story built on the collection of some pieces of litterature. On the other hand, systematic reviews or meta-analyses are, well, systematic, and...<br />

<h2>Network structure of obligate and facultative parasites</h2>
<p class="meta">20 Aug 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>We have a new paper online at Parasitology, on the differences of the structure between rodents hosts, and their obligates of facultatives parasites. We had data from a really cool rodents-ectoparasites system, in which the same hosts have both facultative and obligate parasites. These data were also collected in different locations, and at different times. There are two important things in the results. First, the networks of obligate and facultative parasites look nothing alike. One...<br />

<h2>Complexity and connectance of ecological networks</h2>
<p class="meta">19 Aug 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>So my blog post on ecological complexity in networks turned into a manuscript, now online as a preprint at PeerJ. We’ll send it up for review (at PeerJ also) in a while, but feel free to read it and give us feedback using the github issues tracker. We’d like that very much, actually. And as the github repository is public, feel free to fork/edit/push modifications if you have something to contribute to the paper. In...<br />
