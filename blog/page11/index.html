  <h1>Article introductions and the reinvention of the ecological wheel</h1>
  <div class="postinfo">January 28, 2013 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="label radius small" style="margin-right: 3px;">scientific publishing</span><span class="label radius small" style="margin-right: 3px;">ecological theory</span><span class="label radius small" style="margin-right: 3px;">scientific literature</span></div>
  <p>
    Caroline Tucker and Marc Cadotte recently had a great blog post discussing the reinvention of the ecological wheel, with special mention of the biodiversity-ecosystem-functioning (BEF) literature. I read this blog post with a lot of interest, for reasons that I will mention in a later post. The basic issue was that: Some of the findings in the BEF literature could be criticized as simply being rediscoveries of classical theory and experimental evidence already in existence. I&#39;ll keep my opinion about whether I agree or not with this, and whether or not I think some rediscoveries are useful, for later. Caroline...

  <h1>Using forums to communicate with students</h1>
  <div class="postinfo">January 26, 2013 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="label radius small" style="margin-right: 3px;">teaching</span></div>
  <p>
    This fall, I gave a series of lectures in Population and Community Biology, for a group of 52 undergrads. I really love teaching, and having my own course to give all by myself is a blast. But it&#39;s a lecture, and as a student, I was not a big fan of them. Not enough interaction. You learn more by interacting than by listening, and even though it&#39;s possible to do participative lectures, it&#39;s hard; at least I think it is, perhaps I still need to find the good recipe. There are a few reasons for which it&#39;s difficult to get...

  <h1>Where to submit your paper?</h1>

  <p>
    Jeremy Fox offers some advice about how to decide where to submit your paper. Also, read the response by Ethan White. There are possibly as many perspectives on this are there are researchers, which I&#39;ll definitely take as an excuse to present mine. Aim as high as you reasonably can. Then submit a step higher than that. I&#39;ve had really good surprizes with papers being accepted in journals I would have considered too high (speaking purely in term of impact factor). The worth you risk is being rejected (which is short, so you don&#39;t lose anything), or going into review....

  <h1>A selection of Sublime Text 2 packages</h1>
  <div class="postinfo">January 22, 2013 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="label radius small" style="margin-right: 3px;">software</span></div>
  <p>
    Sublime Text 2 is an awesome multi-purpose text editor, working on all major platforms, and generally being vim with a nice GUI, and some emacs thrown in for good measure. Over the last year, it has become my daily weapon of choice. As it offers a complete API, many people developed Python packages for it, and I use a few of them almost daily. Following some discussions we&#39;ve had on twitter, I figured I&#39;d share them with everyone. The first one to install is Sublime Package Control. It allows you to open the command palette, and manage your packages. Notably,...

  <h1>If Elsevier acquires Mendeley, I'm out (and you should be too)</h1>
  <div class="postinfo">January 19, 2013 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="label radius small" style="margin-right: 3px;">open science</span><span class="label radius small" style="margin-right: 3px;">social networks</span></div>
  <p>
    Two days ago, TechCrunch published an article saying that Elsevier was in &quot;advanced talks&quot; to acquire Mendeley. Why a company (Mendeley) whose goal is to help scientist work, and faciliate access to papers, would associate with a company so despised by so many researchers that they are actively and publicly boycotting it (Elsevier) makes absolutely no sense. Some people on the Mendeley advisors group wanted to know more, and here is the reply we got: So it seemed like there was nothing to worry about. All too happy to announce the good news on Twitter, here is the reply I...
