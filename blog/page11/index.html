<h2>COinS metadata in Jekyll blogposts</h2>
<p class="meta">08 Feb 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>COinS is a specification to embed metadata in web pages. In short, when these data are present, most bibliography software are able to add the resource to your library. Having these data in blog posts can be good, because you can keep track of blog posts with your other references, but you can also formally cite blog posts in your papers (if some people can turn blog posts into TREE papers, citing blog posts might...<br />

<h2>Article introductions and the reinvention of the ecological wheel</h2>
<p class="meta">28 Jan 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Caroline Tucker and Marc Cadotte recently had a great blog post discussing the reinvention of the ecological wheel, with special mention of the biodiversity-ecosystem-functioning (BEF) literature. I read this blog post with a lot of interest, for reasons that I will mention in a later post. The basic issue was that: Some of the findings in the BEF literature could be criticized as simply being rediscoveries of classical theory and experimental evidence already in existence....<br />

<h2>Using forums to communicate with students</h2>
<p class="meta">26 Jan 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>This fall, I gave a series of lectures in Population and Community Biology, for a group of 52 undergrads. I really love teaching, and having my own course to give all by myself is a blast. But it’s a lecture, and as a student, I was not a big fan of them. Not enough interaction. You learn more by interacting than by listening, and even though it’s possible to do participative lectures, it’s hard; at...<br />

<h2>Where to submit your paper?</h2>
<p class="meta">24 Jan 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Jeremy Fox offers some advice about how to decide where to submit your paper. Also, read the response by Ethan White. There are possibly as many perspectives on this are there are researchers, which I’ll definitely take as an excuse to present mine. Aim as high as you reasonably can. Then submit a step higher than that. I’ve had really good surprizes with papers being accepted in journals I would have considered too high (speaking...<br />

<h2>A selection of Sublime Text 2 packages</h2>
<p class="meta">22 Jan 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Sublime Text 2 is an awesome multi-purpose text editor, working on all major platforms, and generally being vim with a nice GUI, and some emacs thrown in for good measure. Over the last year, it has become my daily weapon of choice. As it offers a complete API, many people developed Python packages for it, and I use a few of them almost daily. Following some discussions we’ve had on twitter, I figured I’d share...<br />

<h2>If Elsevier acquires Mendeley, I'm out (and you should be too)</h2>
<p class="meta">19 Jan 2013</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Two days ago, TechCrunch published an article saying that Elsevier was in “advanced talks” to acquire Mendeley. Why a company (Mendeley) whose goal is to help scientist work, and faciliate access to papers, would associate with a company so despised by so many researchers that they are actively and publicly boycotting it (Elsevier) makes absolutely no sense. Some people on the Mendeley advisors group wanted to know more, and here is the reply we got:...<br />
