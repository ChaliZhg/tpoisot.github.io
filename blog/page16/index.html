<h2>Biblatex styles for ecology</h2>
<p class="meta">26 Apr 2012</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>A few months ago — when finishing to write my thesis, as I grew increasingly disatisfied by the clumsiness of natbib —, I started looking into biblatex. biblatex is essentially a re-implementation of LaTeX packages like cite, natbib, and others. And the more I used it, the more I realized two things. First, biblatex is awesome; it’s to natbib what knitr is to Sweave. Including the fact that switching from one system to the other...<br />

<h2>Null models of bipartite networks in C</h2>
<p class="meta">15 Apr 2012</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I am currently revising a paper, and I need to run a lot of networks through two null models. And I need to do it a lot of time. I have a Python solution, for a dataset of this size (175 networks, some of them up to 100 x 100 in size), and with the need to have 1000 replicates each time… Python is not the right tool. I’m currently re-learning C, and I thought...<br />

<h2>How to make the most out of peer-review?</h2>
<p class="meta">29 Jan 2012</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>So it seems that the love/hate relationship between science and publishers has reached its tipping point following the RWA turmoil, with appeals to boycott major publishers, such as researchwithoutwalls and thecostofknowledge, and some of the most eminents members of the scientific blogosphere talking about it, and using creative metaphors to illustrate how big of a scam it is. Specifically, most scientists are publicly stating that they will not review papers anymore, at least in the...<br />

<h2>Measuring ecological specificity</h2>
<p class="meta">19 Jan 2012</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Our paper about measurements of ecological specialization is now available online at the Methods in Ecology &amp; Evolution website. You can also download the associated R package from R-Forge. As a side note, it is during the conception and redaction of this paper that I started thinking more and more about networks, something which is now occupying a significant part of my time, so I have my co-authors to thank for that. Early during my...<br />

<h2>Science in the age of social coding</h2>
<p class="meta">06 Jan 2012</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I started using version control a little more than 6 months ago, when working on my dissertation. Not only it allowed me to have a backup of my chapters somewhere else than on my hard drive, but I could also revert back to a previous version of some paragraphs I liked better. Sometime during the summer, I discovered GitHub, and thought that I can give it a try. A few months later, I’m wondering what...<br />

<h2>Simulated phylogenetic trees and community assembly</h2>
<p class="meta">05 Jan 2012</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I’m working on a toy model of community assembly in Python, and I thought it would be cool to have an easy way to keep track of the phylogeny. To do so, I’ve conceived two classes for the easy handling of phylogenetic structure. They are available on GitHub in the PyCoPhy repository (Python Community Phylogenetics), and check also the code page. The general idea behind them is quite easy to understand. A phylogenetic tree is...<br />
