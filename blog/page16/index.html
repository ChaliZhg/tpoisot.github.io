<h2>Measuring ecological specificity</h2>
<p class="meta">19 Jan 2012</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>Our paper about measurements of ecological specialization is now available online at the Methods in Ecology &amp; Evolution website. You can also download the associated R package from R-Forge. As a side note, it is during the conception and redaction of this paper that I started thinking more and more about networks, something which is now occupying a significant part of my time, so I have my co-authors to thank for that. Early during my...<br />

<h2>Science in the age of social coding</h2>
<p class="meta">06 Jan 2012</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I started using version control a little more than 6 months ago, when working on my dissertation. Not only it allowed me to have a backup of my chapters somewhere else than on my hard drive, but I could also revert back to a previous version of some paragraphs I liked better. Sometime during the summer, I discovered GitHub, and thought that I can give it a try. A few months later, I’m wondering what...<br />

<h2>Simulated phylogenetic trees and community assembly</h2>
<p class="meta">05 Jan 2012</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>I’m working on a toy model of community assembly in Python, and I thought it would be cool to have an easy way to keep track of the phylogeny. To do so, I’ve conceived two classes for the easy handling of phylogenetic structure. They are available on GitHub in the PyCoPhy repository (Python Community Phylogenetics), and check also the code page. The general idea behind them is quite easy to understand. A phylogenetic tree is...<br />

<h2>Goodbye Wordpress, hello Jekyll!</h2>
<p class="meta">01 Jan 2012</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>A few weeks ago, I discovered Jekyll. In a nutshell, Jekyll is a static site generator who promised me I’ll be able to blog like a hacker. This site is now hosted on GitHub, and both the template and the content can be forked, so everything is basically open source. Jekyll is a lot of fun to use, especially because all of the content reside in static text files instead of a database. It’s also...<br />

<h2>The aggregate function in Python</h2>
<p class="meta">01 Dec 2011</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>One thing I love the most about R is the aggregate function, which (in a nutshell) summarizes a data frame according to one or more columns, and perform some operations on the aggregated values. If, for example, you have a data frame with a treatment and a response, and want to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the response by level of treatment, then aggregate is usually the way to go. I wanted to...<br />

<h2>Get your lab on twitter!</h2>
<p class="meta">19 Nov 2011</p>

<div class="post">
   <p>More and more scientists are taking advantage of social networking tools to talk about their research. This trend was even deemed worthy of a paper in Nature this week. I’ve read this paper, and I had mixed feelings about it. On one hand, it was good to see the use of social medias showcased in such a prestigious journal. On the other hand, I felt it came out of nowhere, and was too descriptive. I...<br />
