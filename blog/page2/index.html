	<div class='postinfo'>May 20, 2013</div>
	<p>My wife recently mentionned to me that most of the errors introduced during 454 pyrosequencing were indels rather than point mutations. It may not sound like it, but it's kind of a big deal when measuring similarity between sequences, most likely when you try to do taxonomic identification by comparing to the best match of blast. So to get a "reliable" estimate of the dissimilarity, a reliable strategy is most likely to remove the gaps. As doing it by hand...</p>

	<div class='postinfo'>May 18, 2013</div>
	<p>I tend to use pandoc more and more to write my papers. The syntax of markdown is ligthweight, doesn't get in the way of my writing, and it's easy to export the text to almost any format you can name afterward. The only issue I ran in is that I also like pgfplots a lot for graphics, because they come with the ability to update themselves at each compilation, when the data are re-generated. It's quite important if you want...</p>

	<p>With Phil's paper on preprints out, and the idea that writing manuscripts in the open introduced by Karthik Ram, it's almost not completely crazy to write research papers in an entirely open space, like github or Google Docs. I'm currently doing it (everything with paper or ms in the title of the repository is something not yet published), and so are a few other people. And it's a good thing. It might actually be the better way to disseminate research...</p>

	<p>The Nicholson-Bailey model is a well known model of host and parasitoid population dynamics. It assumes that parasitoids will search a fraction of their habitat for hosts, and then kill them. Yes, it's brutal like that. There are a few fun things with this model. It's light in parameters (the single-patch version requires only three parameters), it's in discrete time (so it's easy to program), and it's classical put on a lattice (so it's a good way to program these...</p>

	<p>I'm glad to announce that we (I, Ross Mounce, and Dom Gravel), have put up a preprint about data sharing in ecology on figshare. The manuscript is under consideration at Ideas in Ecology &amp; Evolution. We try to make a valid point about why ecologists should share their data, how we can do it in practice, and the role that funding agencies and journals can play. And speaking of preprints, but also sure to check out Philippe's opinion piece on...</p>

	<p>A few days ago, I received an email asking about pointers on how to program in ecology. I'm not sure I'm the best person to ask, but writing the answer, I realized that there might be potential to share tips with other people. Now, a little bit of foreword.

	<p>Mendeley was recently acquired by public enemy Elsevier in a puzzling move. Some of you may remember that I've announced that, should this acquisition happen, I'll be out of here. Actually, I've switched to Zotero a while back and never ever looked back. But still. Mr. Will Gunn himself asked me to do a follow-up post, on the basis that it's not as bad as I feared.

	<p>E.O. Wilson recently published an editorial entitled "Great scientists don't need math" in the Wall Street Journal. Jeremy Fox wrote a great rebuttal of it, which you should certainly read as well. In short, Wilson's argument is that most of great science is the work of intuition. In Jean Cocteau's words, science is the confirmation of instinct's discoveries. And in this perspective, math literacy is not needed, because it's only a boring formality, to confirm what the "great minds" have...</p>

	<p>High-throughput sequencing (let's abbreviate it as HTS), the ability to generate millions of sequences for a relatively low cost and effort, can make a huge difference in community ecology and biogeography. Think about it this way: for a few days of work, you can get a really exhaustive sampling of the diversity, with measures of relative abundance. I'm currently using 454 pyrosequencing in a project, and when I started reviewing the literature, I was stricken by the fact that there...</p>

	<p>Following yesterday's post on an alternative to barcharts, I decided to write an implementation of this graph in D3.js. The more I play around with it, the more I like it. As it turned out, it was fairly easy, so I'll share the code as a gist. For this particular example, I assume that the data are in a matrix, in csv format, with sites as the first row, and species abundances in columns. I also assume that the abudances...</p>

	<p>I hate stacked bar charts. I see them in so many papers, using the awful Excel default options, and I hate them. I feel them visually unappealing, confusing, and extremely inefficient at displaying information. It's almost impossible to compare the size of two bars without measuring them, which means that they carry less information than a good old table. So I was looking for alternatives to them. Here is the code I ended up with. First let's load a few...</p>

Also, I spent two hours this afternoon playing with D3.js, and I wanted to put what I've learnt in practice. What I want to do is remove each edge, and see how it affects modularity. This is, once again, really easy to do in networkx. We'll just write...</p>

For example, if your network has an important modularity, which nodes are the most responsible for it? I'll just detail how it possible to get this information quickly using networkx. Warning! I'm just using this post to take notes on code I'm currently working on. Saavedra et al. Nature 478...</p>

	<p>COinS is a specification to embed metadata in web pages. In short, when these data are present, most bibliography software are able to add the resource to your library. Having these data in blog posts can be good, because you can keep track of blog posts with your other references, but you can also formally cite blog posts in your papers (if some people can turn blog posts into TREE papers, citing blog posts might not be so far away)....</p>

	<p>Caroline Tucker and Marc Cadotte recently had a great blog post discussing the reinvention of the ecological wheel, with special mention of the biodiversity-ecosystem-functioning (BEF) literature. I read this blog post with a lot of interest, for reasons that I will mention in a later post. The basic issue was that: Some of the findings in the BEF literature could be criticized as simply being rediscoveries of classical theory and experimental evidence already in existence. I'll keep my opinion about...</p>
