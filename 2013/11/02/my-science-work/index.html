               <p>The OpenAccessWeek in France generated a <em>huge</em> backlash, mostly owing to the identity of the organizer. This edition was organized by the for profit “scientific social network” <em>MyScienceWork</em> (I’m not going to link them). <em>My Science Work</em> (<em>MSW</em> henceforth) is a social network in which people can… well, you know what a social network is. This one is yet another social network for scientists, much like Academia.edu and ResearchGate. I don’t care all that much about these tools.</p>
<p>Let’s summarize the situation. The French OpenAccesWeek was organized by <em>My Science Work</em>, and got backed up by several public organisms involved in research: some labs, some universities, other related institutions. During this operation, the credibility of <em>MSW</em> got a huge boost in the French OA community, in large part because of the fact that high-profile institutions lent their credibility to the OpenAccessWeek.</p>
<p>During the OpenAccessWeek itself, the critics started to emerge. <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=fr&amp;sl=fr&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.stephanepouyllau.org%2F709">Stéphane Pouyllau</a> started talking about <em>private open access</em>. Shortly thereafter, <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=fr&amp;sl=fr&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fpenserclasser.wordpress.com%2F2013%2F11%2F02%2Fopenaccessweek_france%2F">Elifsu Sabuncu</a> produced a great synthesis of the most important reactions on twitter and in blogs (both links are through Google translate, which gives a fairly broken but acceptable translation). What are these critics about?</p>
<p>Well, for a “Frontrunner in Open Access”, <em>MSW</em> is surprisingly closed. Their website lists over 28 millions academic papers in Open Access. I tried to access some of mine, and when I clicked on the “Download link”, I got redirected to a login/signup page. Does it seems like a <em>huge</em> problem to you? Because it is. When you put papers behind a wall, you are not advancing Open Access. You are using the OA label to advance your business, and you are not more worthy than a predatory OA publisher. If your goal is to provide a service to the scientists, let us download the papers without signing-up for yet another website we’ll never visit again.</p>
<p>And it’s not like the links to the original publications is easy to spot, either. It’s nowhere to be found on the pages. You have no choice but to signup for their “service”, if you want to get access to the paper (or, well, you can realize that this is bullshit and go find the PDF somewhere else). When some authors took offense with the practice, the heads of <em>MSW</em> proposed to remove their articles from the platform. They were also quite active in insulting some of the most vocal critics on their blogs, which is not a smart move. So it seems that <em>MSW</em> has no will to change their system, and is instead trying to silence the critics (you cannot silence French people - criticism is an <em>art de vivre</em> for us!).</p>
<p>If it were just yet another social network for scientists, I’m sure no one would have cared about their “signup-required” policy. But <em>MSW</em> was, for a week, the face of French Open Access. The closed, greedy, critics-insulting face of French Open Access. So here is your explanation of the huge backslash. People advocating <em>open</em> access took it badly when a business tried to trick people into thinking they were advancing OA, but was instead freeloading on OA initiatives to make money. This is extremely worrisome. Predatory publishing is bad press enough for OA, we really don’t need new forms of predation.</p>
<p>And the next step, after the name calling and the finger pointing will have ended, is to have a good productive debate about <em>open</em> access. Access is not <em>open</em> if you have to pay for it. And the fact that the price you pay for a paper at <em>MSW</em> is not monetary makes no matter: you pay with your information, with your facebook profile, with your email address. When every piece of information about you can be turned into a profit, <strong>every wall is a paywall</strong>. Parasitic behaviors, in which some use the OA label to get credibility, but exploit OA to increase their userbase and their profit, must be denounced <em>en masse</em> by the community. And just for this reason, even so I’m disappointed that the Open Access Week was organized by <em>MSW</em>, I’m glad to see that there is such a massive discussion about the ethics of putting OA papers behind (pay)walls.</p>
