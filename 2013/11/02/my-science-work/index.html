<h1>The (French) paradox of Closed Open Access</h1>

<p>The OpenAccessWeek in France generated a <em>huge</em> backlash, mostly owing to the
identity of the organizer. This edition was organized by the for profit
&ldquo;scientific social network&rdquo; <em>MyScienceWork</em> (I&#39;m not going to link them). <em>My
Science Work</em> (<em>MSW</em> henceforth) is a social network in which people can&hellip;
well, you know what a social network is. This one is yet another social network
for scientists, much like Academia.edu and ResearchGate. I don&#39;t care all that
much about these tools.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s summarize the situation. The French OpenAccesWeek was organized by <em>My
Science Work</em>, and got backed up by several public organisms involved in
research: some labs, some universities, other related institutions. During this
operation, the credibility of <em>MSW</em> got a huge boost in the French OA
community, in large part because of the fact that high-profile institutions
lent their credibility to the OpenAccessWeek.</p>

<p>During the OpenAccessWeek itself, the critics started to emerge. <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=fr&amp;sl=fr&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.stephanepouyllau.org%2F709">Stéphane
Pouyllau </a> started talking about <em>private open access</em>. Shortly
thereafter, <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=fr&amp;sl=fr&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fpenserclasser.wordpress.com%2F2013%2F11%2F02%2Fopenaccessweek_france%2F">Elifsu Sabuncu</a> produced a great synthesis of the most important
reactions on twitter and in blogs (both links are through Google translate,
which gives a fairly broken but acceptable translation). What are these
critics about?</p>

<p>Well, for a &ldquo;Frontrunner in Open Access&rdquo;, <em>MSW</em> is surprisingly closed. Their
website lists over 28 millions academic papers in Open Access. I tried to
access some of mine, and when I clicked on the &ldquo;Download link&rdquo;, I got
redirected to a login/signup page. Does it seems like a <em>huge</em> problem to you?
Because it is. When you put papers behind a wall, you are not advancing Open
Access. You are using the OA label to advance your business, and you are not
more worthy than a predatory OA publisher. If your goal is to provide a service
to the scientists, let us download the papers without signing-up for yet
another website we&#39;ll never visit again. </p>

<p>And it&#39;s not like the links to the original publications is easy to spot,
either. It&#39;s nowhere to be found on the pages. You have no choice but to
signup for their &ldquo;service&rdquo;, if you want to get access to the paper (or,
well, you can realize that this is bullshit and go find the PDF
somewhere else). When some authors took offense with the practice,
the heads of <em>MSW</em> proposed to remove their articles from the platform.
They were also quite active in insulting some of the most vocal critics on
their blogs, which is not a smart move. So it seems that <em>MSW</em> has no will
to change their system, and is instead trying to silence the critics (you
cannot silence French people - criticism is an <em>art de vivre</em> for
us!).</p>

<p>If it were just yet another social network for scientists, I&#39;m sure no one
would have cared about their &ldquo;signup-required&rdquo; policy. But <em>MSW</em> was, for
a week, the face of French Open Access. The closed, greedy, critics-insulting
face of French Open Access. So here is your explanation of the huge backslash.
People advocating <em>open</em> access took it badly when a business tried to trick
people into thinking they were advancing OA, but was instead freeloading on OA
initiatives to make money. This is extremely worrisome. Predatory publishing is
bad press enough for OA, we really don&#39;t need new forms of predation.</p>

<p>And the next step, after the name calling and the finger pointing will have
ended, is to have a good productive debate about <em>open</em> access. Access is not
<em>open</em> if you have to pay for it. And the fact that the price you pay for
a paper at <em>MSW</em> is not monetary makes no matter: you pay with your
information, with your facebook profile, with your email address. When every
piece of information about you can be turned into a profit, <strong>every wall is
a paywall</strong>. Parasitic behaviors, in which some use the OA label to get
credibility, but exploit OA to increase their userbase and their profit, must
be denounced <em>en masse</em> by the community. And just for this reason, even so I&#39;m
disappointed that the Open Access Week was organized by <em>MSW</em>, I&#39;m glad to see
that there is such a massive discussion about the ethics of putting OA papers
behind (pay)walls.</p>
