             <h2>Teach more maths to the undergrads!</h2>
<p class="meta">28 Aug 2013</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Fred Barraquand, a bunch of INNGE-and-friends-of-INNGE people, and I, just
published a <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/53/">preprint</a> at <em>Peer J</em> about quantitative training in
early-career ecologists (or rather, the lack thereof). Talking about how much
maths is needed during training is all the rage in the ecological community,
and both sides of the argument have really good arguments.</p>

<p>So Fred decided to do a survey of early-career (and older) ecologists through
<em>ECOLOG-L</em>. Quoting directly from the abstract, this is what we found:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We found a clear self-perceived lack of quantitative training: <strong>75% are not
satisfied with their understanding of mathematical models</strong>; 75% feel the level
of mathematics was “too low” in their ecology classes; 90% wanted more
mathematics classes for ecologists; and 95% more statistics classes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a lot of number to process, but basically all point to the same
message: with a few more years of experience after your undergraduate degree,
you wish you have studied more maths (it’s especially true for me). We
conclude the paper by exploring recommendations about how to (re)design
curriculum using the results from this survey.</p>

<p>I discussed this result with my B.Sc. class last fall. We had a fun exchange,
and over time, the polarization between animal-watchers and number-crunchers
(the 2 or 3 of them) decreased. But here is the fun thing. When I asked the
students whether the found plausible that they’ll wish for strong
quantitative training in a few years, they said yes. Immediately afterwards,
when I asked what they would do if we increased the part of quantitative
training up to 30% of all classes, as survey respondent suggested. To a vast
majority, they would not enroll.</p>

<p>So, it seems like we’ll need to sneakily teach quantitative skills…</p>
