<div class='post-meta'>Written by Tim</div>
<p>Early in July, Christopher Lortie published a really great preprint on <em>PeerJ</em>,
about the <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/39/">opportunities of systematic reviews for ecology</a>. It&#39;s
extremely insightful, and a good read. The abstract starts by <em>Narrative
reviews are dead</em>. No they&#39;re not, nor shouldn&#39;t they be! <em>Narrative</em> reviews are those we are used to read now: a story built on the
collection of some pieces of litterature. On the other hand, systematic reviews
or meta-analyses are, well, systematic, and try to reach a consensus (at least
a generalizable result) through the analysis of everything published on
a particular topic (I abusively generalize, but go read the paper and you&#39;ll
get the idea).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>There is something fascinating about science. One gets such wholesale returns of conjecture out of such a trifling investment of fact.</em><br>
Mark Twain</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I get the idea that narrative reviews are more likely to reflect the author(s)
personal biases or interests, and in our quest for absolute impartiality, it
would make sense to get rid of this. This is the whole point of Chris&#39;s
paper: as the goal of a review is to give an overview of the
state-of-the-art in a particular field, then non-narrative reviews are the
<em>better</em> tool. Nonetheless, I think this is an over-simplification of the
way people <em>use</em> review papers.</p>

<p>As a Ph.D. candidate, <em>narrative</em> reviews helped me a lot when I was trying to
get an idea of the history of the field. Being able to understand how current
ideas emerged from previous observations and results, and seeing which papers
influenced which authors, was important when I had to develop my own research
questions. I won&#39;t spend time on the argument that narrative reviews are great
teaching material, and that it&#39;s a gentler introduction to a field to be walked
through a concept rather than to read through tables of ANOVA. I enjoy these
much more when I have an idea of the &quot;story&quot; behind.</p>

<p>Essentially, narrative reviews should not be discarded because they serve
a different purpose from systematic reviews. Let&#39;s take the example of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_biosphere"><em>rare biosphere</em></a> in environmental microbiology. For several
historical reasons, it has been hypothesized that the distribution of
biodiversity has a long-tail, with a lot of species being in extremely low
abundances. Classical sampling and enumeration technique only described the tip
of the iceberg. Fast forward a few years later, and the existence of the rare
biosphere is well established, and people start questioning its impact in
ecosystem processes, among other things. How we switched from &quot;it probably
exists&quot; to &quot;we need to understand what it&#39;s doing&quot; is best understood with
a little bit of narration. Specifically, the development of molecular biology
methods, and recently high-throughput sequencing, increased our detection
ability by order of magnitudes. The emergence of new tools (which in the
perspective of people like <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/28780545/Gutting-Bachelard-s-Philosophy-of-Science-1987">Bachelard, only reflects the emergence of new
theories</a> that progressively materialized) allowed a switch in the way
people studied rare biosphere. A <em>narrative</em> review of the question will likely
put this element forward.</p>

<p>A systematic review will hold different informations. While the narrative
review aks <em>How did we get there?</em>, the systematic review asks <em>Where are we
now?</em>. They give different answers, but it&#39;s hard to argue that one of these
questions has more merit than the other. Interestingly, more and more reviews
conclude by asking <em>Where to next?</em>. Both narrative and systematic reviews can
bring different elements, and thus will likely bring different responses. This
multiplicity of points of views should not be so rapidly dismissed. Narrative
reviews should be continued <em>because</em> they are often not entirely impartial,
reflects biases or personnal preferences, and because they tell
stories. Once we are familiar with this story, and once we know the
different interpretations that people make of the same data, it&#39;s time
to go read the systematic reviews, and the meta-analyses. I appreciate
that people will enjoy one of these more than the other, or would
prefer to read statistics before naration. But I think we should
continue reading, and writing, narrative reviews.</p>

<p>As a final point, whatever you may think of the issue, go read the &quot;companion&quot;
paper about the <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/38/"><em>interpretation</em></a> of meta-analyses in ecology. It&#39;s
a really good introduction.</p>
