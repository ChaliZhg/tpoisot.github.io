<div class="post">
<p>F1000Research just put up a <a href="http://blog.f1000research.com/2013/08/08/ecologists-join-our-open-science-ecosystem/">new blog post</a> to announce that they
will concentrate some of their efforts to increase the proportion of ecology
papers they publish. We should all be excited about this. First, the article
processing fees will be waived until 2014, so here goes a good opportunity to
see for yourself how this journal works. Second, the publication model of
F1000Research is extremely interesting. After initial checking, the paper is
put on-line, and appears as a preprint. Reviews appear in real-time, and are
not anonymous. Further changes to the paper are well documented.</p>

<p>As we discuss in <a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001563">Phil’s paper</a> paper on preprints in biology, this
immediate publication model is good, especially for early-career people. When
you need to have something to show for your work in order to apply for
a fellowship, it’s understandable that you don’t want to wait for up to a whole
year for your paper to run the gauntlet of peer review. F1000Research also
integrates tightly with figshare, and datasets are required to be open when the
paper is submitted. That’s a really good practice, and it will further the
integration between datasets and papers.</p>

<p>One of the coolest things for field ecologists (I’ve been informed that ecology
is the study of populations, and not a branch of applied mathematics or
computer sciences…?) is that F1000Research will now offer to publish
<em>observation articles</em>. People in the medical sciences have many case studies,
that are extremely important to the field as a whole. In ecology, despite
the recognition that general laws are elusive and not as general as they
appear, there seems to be a shortage of places to publish interesting
field/lab observations. I’m sure many people will be deligthed to learn that
the modern publishing world still cares about the naturalist tradition of
ecology.</p>

<p>So you can head to the <a href="http://f1000research.com">F1000Research</a> website and
see for yourself!</p>
