<p>Jeremy Fox offers some advice about <a href="http://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2013/01/24/advice-how-to-decide-where-to-submit-your-paper/"><em>how to decide where to submit your paper</em></a>. Also, read the response by <a href="http://jabberwocky.weecology.org/2013/01/24/some-alternative-advice-on-how-to-decide-where-to-submit-your-paper/">Ethan White</a>. There are possibly as many perspectives on this are there are researchers, which I&#39;ll definitely take as an excuse to present mine.</p>

<p><strong>Aim as high as you reasonably can.</strong> Then submit a step higher than that. I&#39;ve had really good surprizes with papers being accepted in journals I would have considered <em>too high</em> (speaking purely in term of impact factor). The worth you risk is being rejected (which is short, so you don&#39;t lose anything), or going into review. Which means receving comments, which will better your paper.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t just go by journal prestige; consider “fit”.</strong> I don&#39;t really believe in this one. As I&#39;ve mentionned before, I believe <a href="http://timotheepoisot.fr/2012/05/11/ecological-journal-of-the-future/">much more in <em>papers</em> than in <em>journals</em></a>. Being published in a <em>good</em> journal does not makes your paper good. Being published in a <em>bad</em> journal does not decrease the worth of your paper. I also think that the way we survey the literature changed a lot, with social networks and RSS; perhaps I&#39;m wrong on this point, but I think that (at least for the younger generation) our view of the litterature focuses much more on papers than journals. In this perspective, the &quot;fit&quot; of the journal do not really matter. Elaborating a little bit more, initiatives like <em>F1000Research</em> or <em>eLife</em> are designed to be paper repositories. Where <em>fit</em> do not matter. Then, it&#39;s your job to advertize your paper, and make sure people are aware of it.</p>

<p><strong>How much will it cost?</strong> I&#39;m sure that most of the time, people are happy to pay the costs associated to a publication. And waivers are relatively easy to obtain.</p>

<p><strong>How likely is the journal to send your paper out for external review?</strong> I have really no opinion about this. I used to think it matters, but I&#39;ve had weird experiences this past year. I think it boils downs to <em>&quot;How good are you at writing cover letters?&quot;</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Is the journal open access?</strong> This is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma">false dilemna</a>, in my opinion. Journals can not be open access, yet have open access mandates for some articles. <em>Ecology Letters</em> does, most of the <em>Springer</em> journals do as well. I think the question should be: <em>&quot;How open is the journal to new practices?&quot;</em>. This includes <em>ArXiV</em>, putting data online in the open, and so forth. My feeling is that the younger people are really aware of these issues. My opinion is that <em>open access</em> is the tree (badly) hiding the forest, and we should do more than fighting for the access to the papers.</p>

<p><strong>Does the journal evaluate papers only on technical soundness?</strong> Surprizingly, I don&#39;t care much about this. I thought <em>PLoS One</em> worked this way, and in my experience, it is not the case. Probably because the academic editors don&#39;t follow the rule. Also my research is wonderful and innovative, of course.</p>

<p class='margin'>Rohr & Martin (2012) <em>Tr Ecol Evol</em> 27(4)</p>

<p><strong>Is the journal part of a review cascade?</strong> This can be important, but again, this is not ambitious enough. Why not <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22341497">systematizing the process of review transfer</a>? First, it will reduce the feeling that there are sinks and sources in journals (not saying it&#39;s not true, but there is a stigma on some journals because they are essentially perceived as <em>Not good enough for [other journal]</em>).</p>

<p><strong>Is it a society journal?</strong> Frankly my dear, I don&#39;t give a damn.</p>

<p><strong>Have you had good experiences with the journal in the past?</strong> Sure. But I&#39;ve also had terrible experiences with some journals, and I&#39;m still considering submitting something to them in the future. Ironically enough, because <em>they fit</em>. And I&#39;ve had really good experiences with some journals, even though they keep rejecting everything I submit to them; but they do it with class? I honestly don&#39;t know.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anyone on the editorial board who’d be a good person to handle your paper?</strong> I try to see which editors can be a good fit. But it&#39;s not really a decision-making or decision-breaking factor.</p>

<p>So in a few words, I think we should focus less on the journals. Papers will end somewhere eventually, even if it&#39;s on <em>FigShare</em>. But I think the exerice is interesting, and actually I&#39;d like to see other people share their opinions. There is much to learn about how we make our decisions, and probably a lot of potential to see which areas need improving as well.</p>
