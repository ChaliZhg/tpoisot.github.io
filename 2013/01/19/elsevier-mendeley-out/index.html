<p>Two days ago, <em>TechCrunch</em> published an article saying that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/17/elsevier-mendeley-education/"><em>Elsevier</em> was in &quot;advanced talks&quot; to acquire <em>Mendeley</em></a>. Why a company (<em>Mendeley</em>) whose goal is to help scientist work, and faciliate access to papers, would associate with a company so despised by so many researchers that they are actively and publicly <a href="http://thecostofknowledge.com/">boycotting it</a> (<em>Elsevier</em>) makes absolutely no sense.</p>

<p>Some people on the <em>Mendeley advisors group</em> wanted to know more, and here is the reply we got:</p>

<p><img src="/images/mendeley-advisors-elsevier.png" alt="Figure1"></p>

<p>So it seemed like there was nothing to worry about. All too happy to announce the good news on Twitter, here is the reply I got:</p>

<p><img src="/images/mendeley-twitter-rumors.png" alt="Figure2"></p>

<p>Well, reading this, I&#39;m not sure anymore I don&#39;t need to worry. Now, this corporate talk when discussing the possible acquisition is not surprizing (<em>Mendeley</em> is, after all, a company), coming from the very people who <a href="http://blog.mendeley.com/open-access/support-free-access-to-scientific-journal-articles-arising-from-taxpayer-funded-research-oamonday/">were so supportive of open access</a> (though, <a href="https://twitter.com/mrgunn/status/292479547079794688">contrary to what William Gunn said on <em>Twitter</em></a>, I was unable to find mentions of <em>Elsevier</em> on the <em>Mendeley</em> blog).</p>

<p>I&#39;m a <em>Mendeley</em> advisor. I&#39;ve used the tool over the last two years, and I&#39;ve been converting people to it, and helping them, and for the most part, it&#39;s been fun. <em>Mendeley</em> is still the only non-open source tool on my laptop, except for <em>Sublime Text</em>. That&#39;s how big of a concession I&#39;m making, because the software is good. But the second <em>Elsevier</em> acquires <em>Mendeley</em>, or the two start walking hand in hand? I&#39;m out.</p>

<p>First, I&#39;ve signed the <a href="http://thecostofknowledge.com/"><em>Cost of Knowledge</em></a> petition, and I don&#39;t want to be involved with <em>Elsevier</em>. I won&#39;t review for them, or submit to their journals. Second, I don&#39;t want them to use the data I generate. This is why I&#39;ll be leaving, and this is why I think other <em>Mendeley</em> users should too, if this acquisition happens. The position of <em>Elsevier</em> on text mining is <a href="http://researchremix.wordpress.com/2012/04/13/elsevier-response/">well known</a>, and in part responsible for their bad reputation with scientists and the open-access movement.</p>

<p>When you add a paper on <em>Mendeley</em>, you generate data. What do you read? Who do you read? Who send you papers, from which journals? These are important informations, that <em>Elsevier</em> will perhaps be able to use to turn a profit, and I don&#39;t want that. <a href="http://blog.findings.com/post/20527246081/how-we-will-read-clay-shirky">Publishing is not a job, it&#39;s a <em>button</em></a>; we pay enough for people to press this button, although other solutions (<a href="http://innge.net/?q=node/327"><em>Scholastica</em></a>, <a href="http://innge.net/?q=node/330">preprints servers</a>) exists. The web <em>was (in part) designed</em> to <a href="http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2010/01/04/why-hasnt-scientific-publishing-been-disrupted-already/">disrupt scholarly publishing</a>, but failed. Let&#39;s not then let scientific publishers use the data we, scientists, generate for free, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/aug/29/academic-publishers-murdoch-socialist">to continue increasing their profits</a>.</p>

<p>Did I say &quot;for free&quot;? Sorry, I meant <a href="http://www.mendeley.com/upgrade/storage/">$4.99 a month</a> (although, full disclosure, as a <em>Mendeley advisor</em>, I get free hosting). And call me an extremist, but I don&#39;t want anything to do with a company that makes you pay to generate data, which will be used by another company which is the poster child of a domain who replaced Paul Feyerabend as <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/jan/16/academic-publishers-enemies-science"><em>the worst enemy of science</em></a>. So I&#39;m hoping that this is indeed just a rumor, and that <em>Mendeley</em> is attentive enough to what scientists think, and will not associate with <em>Elsevier</em>. But if this is not the case, I&#39;ll cancel my subscription; and I think you should too.</p>
