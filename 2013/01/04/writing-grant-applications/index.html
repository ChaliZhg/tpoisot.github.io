		<h1 class='ptitle'>Writing grant applications can be fun</h1>

		<div class='postinfo'>
			January  4, 2013 &mdash;
			
				<a class='post-tag' href="/tags/#grants-ref" title="tag">grants</a>
			
		</div>

		<p>Most of my summer, and a substantial part of whatever time in fall was left after teaching, went into applying to various grants and positions. It's a frustrating experience, because it's time not spent doing research. But as I had no other possibility than doing it, I tried to make the experience enjoyable, and I even found myself learning a few things along the way. I've done my PhD in a French university, and it's very different from what happens in the rest of the world. Most notably, as the time to completion is fixed to three years, you usually start with a well defined project (though I was able to modify mine as I went). The consequence is that you don't have to write your research proposal. So these last few months were (almost) the first time I had to invest a massive amount of time in trying to con(vince) someone into funding my research.</p>

<h1>It forces you to understand your research</h1>

<p>I try to show how my previous research accomplishments make me the best suited candidate for a grant or position. Doing so requires to show how these previous experiences are actually cohesive, and can be used as the foundation for a research program.  It's a good exercise, and a good feeling as well. Kind of like when all the terms in an equation begin to simplify, and you find the solution to be quite elegant. You know what your research achieved, and what you can do with it now.</p>

<p>More importantly, perhaps, is that fact that you need to replace your different papers into the broader interests of your fellow scientists. What you've produced, taken together with other researchers' output, can open new perspectives. Showing that you have this broad overview is good, and the process of self-reflexion needed to acquire it was definitely helpful to me. It led me to re-emphasize some project, and put some others on the back-burner because I was not sure of where they stand in the landscape of current research ideas.</p>

<h1>It's a good time to read a lot</h1>

<p>Of course, getting the very broad overview of what is happening in your field requires to keep up to date with the literature. And if we all know our classics, it's always more difficult to keep an eye on every new empirical study, field data, and remotely related modeling paper that comes out. I used <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/view/">Google Reader</a> to aggregate the RSS feeds of a lot of different journals, and <a href="http://googlescholar.blogspot.ca/2012/08/scholar-updates-making-new-connections.html">Google Scholar updates</a> and <a href="http://mystudiouslife.wordpress.com/2012/01/10/mendeley-v1-3-mendeley-suggest/">Mendeley Suggest</a> to get alerts about some papers related to my interests. Both tools are, by the way, extremely powerful, and I check them more and more often to get personalized suggestions about what to read.</p>

<p>I found that reading a lot of papers is a good thing when presenting your research project. It can provide a good lead-in to your proposal, as you show some unexplained or unexpected patterns, and argue that your research can help understanding them. You will also find new examples, and use them to strengthen why your field need the answers you'll be able to bring. Even when writing review papers, I've read mostly on very focused topics. Trying to generate several research axes forced me to diversify my readings. I've discovered new questions, new authors, and it helped in re-focusing some of my current projects (and the projects I presented in the different proposals).</p>

<h1>You need to reach a broad audience</h1>

<p>Depending on the type of grant or proposal, the people evaluating your document can come from very various fields. In one instance, some of the people doing the first round of project selection were from fields far outside ecology and evolution. And you need to convince these people that your project is important. They are not expert reviewers who know the trending research questions and the methodology. They are, as far as the specifics of your field go, laymen and laywomen.</p>

<p>But you'll also have to convince more specialized people, and you'll need to do so in the same text. I've found that my experience in vulgarization helped a great deal for this exercise. But in any case, to be appealing to a wide audience, you need to take an extra step back, and show not only how your research is cohesive with what is happening in your field, but also why it is interesting <em>per se</em>. When you've managed to do it, you can say "You know what? My research is actually kinda cool!".</p>

<h1>You will get organized (whether you like it or not)</h1>

<p>Most of the grants applications I've had to write ended with something like a tentative schedule. At first I hated it, because I believe in serendipity. But then I realized that it's actually a good thing, and I wrote one such section even when it was not explicitly required. It forced me to ask myself a really important question: where do I think I'll be able to bring these ideas in the next 6 months, two years, five years? What kind of projects do I want to do, and what is the best (least costly, faster, and most risk-free) way to do what I propose?</p>

<p>So yes, I've learned a lot while writing grant applications, so some good will come out of it whether they are successful of not. But for all the fun I've had, I can't wait to go back to actually <em>doing</em> some science. Once I've graded the undergrads papers. And replied to the referees for papers needing revisions. And applied to money to get me to workshops. So, perhaps someday...</p>
