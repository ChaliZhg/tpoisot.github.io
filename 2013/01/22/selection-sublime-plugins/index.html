<div class='post-title'>January 22, 2013<a class="readmore" href="/2013/01/22/selection-sublime-plugins/">A selection of Sublime Text 2 packages</a></div>
<div class='post-meta'>Written by Tim</div>
<p><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2"><em>Sublime Text 2</em></a> is an awesome multi-purpose text editor, working on all major platforms, and generally being <code>vim</code> with a nice GUI, and some <code>emacs</code> thrown in for good measure. Over the last year, it has become my daily weapon of choice. As it offers a complete API, many people developed <em>Python</em> packages for it, and I use a few of them almost daily. Following some discussions we&#39;ve had on twitter, I figured I&#39;d share them with everyone. The first one to install is <a href="http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control"><em>Sublime Package Control</em></a>. It allows you to open the command palette, and manage your packages. Notably, you can use the <code>Install packages</code> command to get a drop-down list of <em>all</em> possible packages available. They are also listed <a href="http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/community">here</a>.</p>

<p>So which packages do I use? I made a list of those I find the more useful, ranked by use frequency.</p>

<p>The first one is <strong>LaTeX Tools</strong>. It&#39;s plain awesome. You work on a LaTeX document, hit <code>Ctrl-B</code>, and it uses <code>latexmk</code> to take care of <em>all</em> the necessary compilation steps for you. And it implements <code>synctex</code> as well, so you can use <code>Ctrl-L J</code> to jump to the PDF, and right click on the PDF to jump to the text. Add a few other <a href="https://github.com/SublimeText/LaTeXTools">great shortcuts</a> (transform a word in an environment with <code>Ctrl-L E</code>, or in a command with <code>Ctrl-L C</code>, for example), a very extensive auto-completion, and you have one of the best LaTeX editors available. Also, when using this package, do not forget that pressing <code>alt-q</code> anywhere in a line will hard wrap the paragraph. It&#39;s almost impossible to live without this function when you use git.</p>

<p>A really good companion to the above package is <strong>WordCount</strong>. It does what the name says: add a word and character count in the status bar. It updates the word count in real time, and when you mostly write using <em>Markdown</em> or plain text, it&#39;s extremely useful. To write in <em>Markdown</em>, which includes this blog, and most of the drafts of my papers, all the replies to referees, my meeting notes, and general note taking, I rely on <strong>MarkdownBuild</strong>, which allows to <a href="https://github.com/erinata/SublimeMarkdownBuild">quickly visualize</a> the content of the file. A simple <code>Ctrl-B</code> brings up a browser windows with a HTML/CSS rendition of my file. When the documents are ready, I use <code>pandoc</code> to compile them. There are two packages for this, <strong>Pandoc</strong>, which provides a lot of output formats, and <strong>Pandoc Academic</strong>, which provides less formats, but is reachable in less keystrokes. Both also have some complementary snippets, so I keep both.</p>

<p>There are some plugins for <code>git</code>, but I don&#39;t use them, as I do my commits from the command line. Speaking of command line, though, the <strong>Sublime REPL</strong> package is difficult to avoid. It allows you to <a href="https://github.com/wuub/SublimeREPL">run a variety of shells from within a tab in Sublime Text 2</a>. Among the included languages are Python (including iPython), R, and a few others. You can also run a system shell, which I use to do my commits.</p>

<p>I also like <strong>Align Tab</strong> a lot. If you write in LaTeX, or use <code>csv</code> data, you know what this one is doing. Select a block of text, open the command palette and choose <code>Align tabular</code>, give the separator string, and <em>bam!</em>, a perfectly aligned table.</p>

<p>Going from this</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">a b c d
1 2 21 3
abc dd e 456</code></pre></div>

<p>to this</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">a    b   c   d 
1    2   21  3  
abc  dd  e   456</code></pre></div>

<p>means a whole lot in terms of readability. </p>

<p>And while we&#39;re at readability, let&#39;s talk about color schemes. The defaults are good, but not impressive. My favorites are by far from <a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16">the <strong>base16</strong> project</a>. I&#39;m fond of <code>Tomorrow Light</code> and <code>Railscasts Dark</code>, but many, many others are impressive as well.</p>

<p>When coding, I use <strong>AndyPython</strong> and <strong>SublimeCodeIntel</strong>. They provide some good auto-completion, and code intelligence. So it means that I don&#39;t need to remember the methods I put in my classes! And any technology allowing me to get progressively lazier is good (probably, I&#39;d check it, but it would involve some efforts). All jokes aside, when working with large python libraries (<code>networkx</code> or <code>scipy</code> come to mind), it&#39;s almost impossible to do without these packages.</p>

<p>So be sure to check <em>Sublime Text 2</em> out. It&#39;s not free (but not too expensive either), and even if you don&#39;t pay, you can use the full feature set (and it is really, really impressive). Think of it as a <em>Photoshop</em> of text editing. After a year of using it, I realize I am probably exploiting less than 10% of its potential. It&#39;s one of the best pieces of software I&#39;ve came across! And if you want to know more, <a href="http://nature.berkeley.edu/%7Ekram/">Karthik Ram</a> has a list of <a href="http://pinboard.in/u:karthik/t:sublimetext">bookmarks</a> about it, which I encourage you to browse.</p>
