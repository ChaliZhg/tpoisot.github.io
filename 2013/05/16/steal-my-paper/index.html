<p>With Phil&#39;s <a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001563">paper</a>
on preprints out, and the idea that writing manuscripts in the open
<a href="http://www.scfbm.org/content/8/1/7/">introduced</a> by Karthik Ram, it&#39;s almost not
completely crazy to write research papers in an entirely open space, like
<em>github</em> or <em>Google Docs</em>. I&#39;m currently <a href="https://github.com/tpoisot/">doing it</a>
(everything with <code>paper</code> or <code>ms</code> in the title of the repository is something not
yet published), and so are a few other people. And it&#39;s a good thing. It might
actually be the better way to disseminate research fast. Not to mention that
version controlling will help people studying scientists a great deal: you can
now have a real-time analysis of how a paper is made. It also increases
accountability, but see Karthik&#39;s paper for that.</p>

<p>There is another benefit which has not been highlighted quite enough in my
opinion. Putting your papers in the open is a good way to attract comments, and
possibly collaborators. People can see what you are working on, and they&#39;ll be
able to assist if they feel like they will make a contribution. This has been
a major strength of the whole open source software movement, and there is no
reason that it will have opposite consequences in science (that&#39;s, again, my
sligthly idealistic opinion). Clearly I don&#39;t expect that any paper I put
out there will result in new, surprizing collaborations, with people I had no
previous connexions with (though it happened exactly this way for our <a href="https://github.com/tpoisot/DataSharingPaper">data sharing MS</a>.
But the point is that it <em>can</em> happen, and that would be really great.</p>

<p>When I brought that up to some people, I&#39;ve had a common question in return:
what about cheaters? That&#39;s a legitimate question, and I hadn&#39;t thought much
about it before. There are two ways people could try to abuse this new, more
open system. The first one is outright theft. I fork your repository, remove
your name from the author list, put it in the acknowledgements, and submit the
paper somewhere. I&#39;m not sure how strongly it would be breaking the terms of the
<code>CC-BY</code> licence. But it would break almost all of the unwritten conventions of
the academic word, and I don&#39;t think anyone will be foolish enough to destroy
its carreer in such a specatcular way. I&#39;m not sure that editors would
appreciate the move, either.</p>

<p>Another form of cheating is more indirect: what if some people try to get
themselves involved in a majority of open papers, to inflate their publication
list? What if some poeple contribute to open papers, but keep their own papers
closed? Well, again, I&#39;m sure these people will be promtply identified, and
everyone will just ignore them. So clearly, I&#39;m not too worried about people
gaming the system (please don&#39;t prove me wrong). Will some people try? Probably.
Will they risk being alienated by the rest of their field for doing so? Almost
certainly. Does the risk of people cheating outweighs the benefits of more
openness? I don&#39;t think so. Plus, we barely have enough time to work on our own
papers anyway...</p>

<p>Interstingly enough, a point I never heard is: what if <em>I&#39;m</em> the bad guy? What
if I put my paper on <em>GitHub</em>, people write me a nice paragraph of discussion,
and I don&#39;t give them (enoguh) credit? That&#39;s a problematic (and quite
interesting point). As much as the development of altmetrics, and the
opportunity to track the impact of datasets, is changing the way we think
about what is a scientific contribution, we still have aboslutely no rules
regarding authorship in an entirely open ecosystem. Do you think the same rules
than before should apply (assuming that, you know, we had these rules to begin
with...)? Is it OK to jump in a paper, make edits, and expect authorship if
these edits are significant enough? And what is &quot;significant enough&quot;? That&#39;s
some of the questions we&#39;ll have to think about along the way...</p>
