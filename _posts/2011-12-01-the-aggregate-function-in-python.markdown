One thing I love the most about R is the [aggregate](http://stat.ethz.ch/R-man
ual/R-devel/library/stats/html/aggregate.html) function, which (in a nutshell)
summarizes a data frame according to one or more columns, and perform some
operations on the aggregated values. If, for example, you have a data frame
with a treatment and a response, and want to calculate the mean and standard
deviation of the response by level of treatment, then aggregate is usually the
way to go.

I wanted to do a quick [plot with errorbars using
PyX](http://pyx.sourceforge.net/examples/graphstyles/errorbar.html), and I
though that having a python version of aggregate would be really nice. Here is
the complete code to do so

    
    import numpy as np
    import scipy as sp  
    def MSD(vec):
    	return [np.mean(vec),np.std(vec)]  
    def aggregate(df,by=0,to=1,func=np.sum):
    	Dat = []
    	ColBy = df.T[by]
    	ColTo = df.T[to]
    	UniqueBy = np.sort(np.unique(ColBy))
    	for ub in UniqueBy:
    		uTo = ColTo[ColBy==ub]
    		Out = func(uTo)
    		Dat.append(np.concatenate(([ub],Out)))
    	return Dat  
    test_df = np.loadtxt('tes1-output.dat')  
    Agr = aggregate(test_df,15,18,MSD)
    sp.savetxt("aggr.dat", Agr)  
    from pyx import *  
    g = graph.graphxy(width=8)
    g.plot(graph.data.file("aggr.dat", x=1, y=2, dy=3),
           [graph.style.symbol(), graph.style.errorbar()])
    g.writePDFfile("errorbar")

As you can see, it is really straightforward. The aggregate function needs
four arguments: the data frame (in this case, a numpy array with two
dimensions), the column for the group to aggregate, and the column for the
response. The last argument is obviously the function which will be applied,
in this case a simple mean Â± standard deviation. In 30 lines of code, you can
easily aggregate your data using python. Of course there is room for
improvement, but this is already working quite well.
