Two days ago, *TechCrunch* published an article saying that [*Elsevier* was in "advanced talks" to acquire *Mendeley*](http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/17/elsevier-mendeley-education/). Why a company (*Mendeley*) whose goal is to help scientist work, and faciliate access to papers, would associate with a company so despised by so many researchers that they are actively and publicly [boycotting it](http://thecostofknowledge.com/) (*Elsevier*) makes absolutely no sense.

Some people on the *Mendeley advisors group* wanted to know more, and here is the reply we got:

So it seemed like there was nothing to worry about. All too happy to announce the good news on Twitter, here is the reply I got:

Well, reading this, I'm not sure anymore I don't need to worry. Now, this corporate talk when discussing the possible acquisition is not surprizing (*Mendeley* is, after all, a company), coming from the very people who [were so supportive of open access](http://blog.mendeley.com/open-access/support-free-access-to-scientific-journal-articles-arising-from-taxpayer-funded-research-oamonday/) (though, [contrary to what William Gunn said on *Twitter*](https://twitter.com/mrgunn/status/292479547079794688), I was unable to find mentions of *Elsevier* on the *Mendeley* blog).

I'm a *Mendeley* advisor. I've used the tool over the last two years, and I've been converting people to it, and helping them, and for the most part, it's been fun. *Mendeley* is still the only non-open source tool on my laptop, except for *Sublime Text*. That's how big of a concession I'm making, because the software is good. But the second *Elsevier* acquires *Mendeley*, or the two start walking hand in hand? I'm out.

First, I've signed the [*Cost of Knowledge*](http://thecostofknowledge.com/) petition, and I don't want to be involved with *Elsevier*. I won't review for them, or submit to their journals. Second, I don't want them to use the data I generate. This is why I'll be leaving, and this is why I think other *Mendeley* users should too, if this acquisition happens. The position of *Elsevier* on text mining is [well known](http://researchremix.wordpress.com/2012/04/13/elsevier-response/), and in part responsible for their bad reputation with scientists and the open-access movement.

When you add a paper on *Mendeley*, you generate data. What do you read? Who do you read? Who send you papers, from which journals? These are important informations, that *Elsevier* will perhaps be able to use to turn a profit, and I don't want that. [Publishing is not a job, it's a *button*](http://blog.findings.com/post/20527246081/how-we-will-read-clay-shirky); we pay enough for people to press this button, although other solutions ([*Scholastica*](http://innge.net/?q=node/327), [preprints servers](http://innge.net/?q=node/330)) exists. The web *was (in part) designed* to [disrupt scholarly publishing](http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2010/01/04/why-hasnt-scientific-publishing-been-disrupted-already/), but failed. Let's not then let scientific publishers use the data we, scientists, generate for free, [to continue increasing their profits](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/aug/29/academic-publishers-murdoch-socialist).

Did I say "for free"? Sorry, I meant [$4.99 a month](http://www.mendeley.com/upgrade/storage/) (although, full disclosure, as a *Mendeley advisor*, I get free hosting). And call me an extremist, but I don't want anything to do with a company that makes you pay to generate data, which will be used by another company which is the poster child of a domain who replaced Paul Feyerabend as [*the worst enemy of science*](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/jan/16/academic-publishers-enemies-science). So I'm hoping that this is indeed just a rumor, and that *Mendeley* is attentive enough to what scientists think, and will not associate with *Elsevier*. But if this is not the case, I'll cancel my subscription; and I think you should too.
