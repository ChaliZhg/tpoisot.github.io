The final paper of my master's project was [published online today in *PLoS One*](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0026252
). It's about how species of a fish parasite, which were defined based on morphological features, may not be actual species, as they have no phylogenetic support.

> *Lamellodiscus* Johnston & Tiegs 1922 (Monogenea, Diplectanidae) is a genus of common parasites on the gills of sparid fishes. Here we show that this genus is probably undergoing a fast molecular diversification, as reflected by the important genetic variability observed within three molecular markers (partial nuclear 18S rDNA, Internal Transcribed Spacer 1, and mitonchondrial *Cytochrome Oxidase I*). Using an updated phylogeny of this genus, we show that molecular and morphological evolution are weakly correlated, and that most of the morphologically defined taxonomical units are not consistent with the molecular data. We suggest that *Lamellodiscus* morphology is probably constrained by strong environmental (host-induced) pressure, and discuss why this result can apply to other taxa. Genetic variability within nuclear 18S and mitochondrial *COI* genes are compared for several monogenean genera, as this measure may reflect the level of diversification within a genus. Overall our results suggest that cryptic speciation events may occur within *Lamellodiscus*, and discuss the links between morphological and molecular evolution.
