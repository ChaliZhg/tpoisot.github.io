The final paper of my master's project was [published online today in _PLoS On
e_](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0026252
). It's about how species of a fish parasite, which were defined based on
morphological features, may not be actual species, as they have no
phylogenetic support.

> _Lamellodiscus_ Johnston & Tiegs 1922 (Monogenea, Diplectanidae) is a genus
of common parasites on the gills of sparid fishes. Here we show that this
genus is probably undergoing a fast molecular diversification, as reflected by
the important genetic variability observed within three molecular markers
(partial nuclear 18S rDNA, Internal Transcribed Spacer 1, and mitonchondrial
_Cytochrome Oxidase I_). Using an updated phylogeny of this genus, we show
that molecular and morphological evolution are weakly correlated, and that
most of the morphologically defined taxonomical units are not consistent with
the molecular data. We suggest that_Lamellodiscus_ morphology is probably
constrained by strong environmental (host-induced) pressure, and discuss why
this result can apply to other taxa. Genetic variability within nuclear 18S
and mitochondrial _COI_ genes are compared for several monogenean genera, as
this measure may reflect the level of diversification within a genus. Overall
our results suggest that cryptic speciation events may occur within
_Lamellodiscus_, and discuss the links between morphological and molecular
evolution.
