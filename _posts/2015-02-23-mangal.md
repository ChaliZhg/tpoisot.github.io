byline: Notes on the brand new version of mangal, a cool database on species interactions
---

I'm really glad to announce that *mangal*, the ecological interaction database,
is now officially live. It means that the `rmangal` package has reached version
1.0.0, and the database is now stable and fit for *actual* science. Take note of
the new url: [mangal.io](http://mangal.io).

The website still has a few rough edges, but it will become gradually better
over the next month or so. Among the new features are a better [data
browser][dbr], an updated page for each taxa with a list of all known
interactions (see the [Mongolian hamster][tex], for example), and integration
with the *CrossRef* API so that bibliographic informations are listed in the
Dataset pages.

And there is an up-to-date [documentation][doc]. We will update the use-cases
really soon. And the best part is, the database comes pre-loaded with 82
networks, representing over 4000 interactions, with many more to come!
