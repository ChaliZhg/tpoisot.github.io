Our [paper] *Towards a sustainable ecological science* is now online at
*Ideas in Ecology and Evolution*. Thanks are due to Karthik Ram for the
invitation. This is going to be a very exciting special issue. If you want
to know more about the paper, the best thing to do is most likely to read it
(it's open access). But in short, we (I, Ross Mounce, and Dominique Gravel),
try to make a point of all the benefits of sharing data in ecology. There
are some parts about licenses, and some parts about `JSON` (because of course
there are).

But besides the content of the paper (that made me think *a lot* about data
sharing), the way we wrote it was extremely fun. Everything was [done on
*GitHub*][gh], in *mardkwon*,and  we've used Issues and all the tricks in
the book to keep track of what needed to be done. It's also the first paper
in which my twitter handle is listed in the contacts, and I'll probably do
that for every paper now.
