Freedom! The final chapter of my thesis is now online on the website of [*Ecological Processes*](http://www.ecologicalprocesses.com/content/2/1/13/abstract). We use data form a field isolated bacteria-phage system to have a network approach of the specialist-generalist coexistence problem. The main result is that, even when controlling for phylogenetic dispersal of hosts, it's better to be a generalist. This signal is highly consistent across the five networks we studied, and goes in the way of recent results on coevolution: if you let a system coevolve long enough, it's expected that generalists will emerge.
