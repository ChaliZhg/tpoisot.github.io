It all started with a rather enigmatic tweet, two weeks ago:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>Any ecologist with a blog, can you send me a message? @<a href="https://twitter.com/inngecologist">inngecologist</a> is starting a cool project!</p>&mdash; Tim (@tpoi) <a href="https://twitter.com/tpoi/status/279596822895419392" data-datetime="2012-12-14T14:40:51+00:00">December 14, 2012</a></blockquote>

Thanks to [Naupaka Zimmerman](http://www.stanford.edu/~naupaka/) today is an important day, as [INNGE](http://www.innge.net/) launches [*EcoBloggers*](http://www.innge.net/?q=ecobloggers), a new platform to aggregate blog posts written by ecologists. Just this morning, there's been some discussion at [*Dynamic Ecology*](https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2013/01/07/trends-in-ecology-blogging/) that ecological blogs may be fading away. One of the hypothesis was that the audience has not reached a critical mass, and there is not much incentive for posting. *EcoBloggers* will aggregate all contents in a single place, much like [*R-bloggers*](http://www.r-bloggers.com/) did with a tremendous success.

For the moment, we aggregate the blogs of people who responded to the first tweet. We're obviously hoping that more and more people will follow, so feel free to contact [@naupakaz](https://twitter.com/naupakaz/) or [@tpoi](https://twitter.com/tpoi/) if you want to join us! We hope that, by putting all the content together in a single place, the readership of all bloggers will increase, and we can use this tool to engage in a great [carnival of (ecological) ideas](http://chronicle.com/article/The-Blogosphere-as-a-Carnival/2674). And who knows, we might a well generate a few new vocations!
