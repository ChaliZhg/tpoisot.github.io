The INNGE network is now officially started, with a short Forum article in the [INTECOL Bulletin](http://www.intecol.net/) (PDF attached at the end of this post). I'm obviously very glad to be part of this effort, which seeks to bring early career ecologists together from around the world, thereby strengthening international ties within a growing global community of ecologists.

The [*Société Française d'Ecologie*](http://www.sfecologie.org/) is supporting this initiative as well. If you want to know more about this network, or want to get involved, most of us will be attending the [ESA meeting in Austin](http://www.esa.org/austin/), this august, do not hesitate to get in
touch using our emails, [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/groups/254873494526193), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/inngecologist).
