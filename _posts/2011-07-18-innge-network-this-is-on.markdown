The INNGE network is now officially started, with a short Forum article in the
[INTECOL Bulletin](http://www.intecol.net/) (PDF attached at the end of this
post). I'm obviously very glad to be part of this effort, which seeks to

> bring early career ecologists together from around the world, thereby
strengthening international ties within a growing global community of
ecologists.

The [_Société Française d'Ecologie_](http://www.sfecologie.org/) is supporting
this initiative as well. If you want to know more about this network, or want
to get involved, most of us will be attending the [ESA meeting in
Austin](http://www.esa.org/austin/), this august, do not hesitate to get in
touch using our emails,
[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/groups/254873494526193), or
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/inngecologist).
