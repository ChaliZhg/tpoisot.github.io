A few weeks ago, I discovered [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). Jekyll is an open-source, blog-aware site generator, who promised me I'll be able to [blog like a hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html). Sold!

I used to rely on Wordpress a lot. But to manage a simple site at this one, [it might be overkill](http://vitobotta.com/migrating-from-wordpress-to-jekyll-part-one-why-I-gave-up-on-wordpress/). In addition, Jekyll allows me to host my content on GitHub, so yes, this whole blog is going open source.
