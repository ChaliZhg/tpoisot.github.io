This fall, I gave a series of lectures in Population and Community Biology, for a group of 52 undergrads. I really love teaching, and having my own course to give all by myself is a blast. But it's a lecture, and as a student, I was not a big fan of them. Not enough interaction. You learn more by interacting than by listening, and even though it's possible to do participative lectures, it's hard; at least I think it is, perhaps I still need to find the good recipe. There are a few reasons for which it's difficult to get students to participate (and by participation, I mean, talk to you, and talk between them). Some of them did not choose the course, and so they don't feel really involved in it (I think this argument is rubbish; they did chose the major, so I expect that they will have at least some interest in the subject). Some of them are really shy, or more generally, peer-pressure is strong. It might be a strong observational bias on my side, but I have the feeling that students in Québec perceive a higher competition between them that what is the case in France, and don't want to give a bad impression. Finally, it might be that the students see you, and you only as an authority figure, and see no interest in discussing course material during the class (see also, competition).

This post was written over the course of six months. I have plans to write more about teaching in the future, because there is some trauma I need to share with you, but let's start by the basics!

As far as I'm concerned, I value communication in less formal setups and smaller groups over the shut-up-and-take-notes approach. Lectures are good at conveying the basic informations, but it's only (my rough estimate) 15% of the course material. Just enough material to highlight what you need to learn, and a list of books to help you locate the information. But even that is somewhat passive, and it's no secret that you retain more information when you go through the reflection yourself, rather than copying the proof, demonstration, or story hidden in the data. The French word for student is *étudiant*, or literally *he who studies*. 

So, before the class started, I brew myself some tea, and brainstormed about how I can realistically make students participate. Not only with me, but also together. Ideally, by coming up with their problems, they would receive input from the others, and things will be solved themselves. My only duty would be to moderate the discussions, and ask some questions so that they go in the "right" way. [Claroline](http://www.claroline.net/), our clumsy, ugly, antiquated [LMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system), allows the creation of forums. Hey, good memories of high school, I thought, it's not like the technology evolved since 2002, so let's give it a try! Thinly veiled sarcasm apart, each lecture had its own forum, and there were only three rules. First, I would not give an answer before other students tried (and if they found the right answer, I'd only confirm, or make comments). Second, what happens in the forums is part of the course material (another way to say that yes, it can end up in an exam sometime). Third, I will not reply to *any* email asking questions about the lectures: everything should go to the forum, so that all students receive the same quantity of information. Also because I don't want to give the same information ten times in a row to ten different students.

Now, we have reached the end of the session, and I thought it was time to take a (qualitative) look back at how things went. In short: it's not as exciting as I thought it would be, but it's not a total failure either. First and foremost, the ready-made forums the university gives us absolutely, positively suck, and have no redeeming qualities. It's clumsy, probably only runs with Nestcape, and is generally ugly and un-friendly. Next time, I'll get rid of this and open a wiki. I'm sure GitHub can be used as a class management system, that's one thing I'm eager to try. Or I'll just have a blog with the lecture notes, and ask the students to comment. I don't know what or when it will be, but it will be high-tech and awesome.

As far as participation went, some interesting things happened. I kind of expected it, but a few students were responsible for most of the discussions. Discussions, which, I noted, went as expected: most of the times, problems were solved by another student, in a relatively short time frame. It was a good thing for me, because I was able to see the faults in the students replies. So I was able to say where they got it wrong (or rather, to ask questions so that they understand themselves why they got it wrong). So if the participation is high enough, there is a possibility that such tools will allow you to evaluate the level of students in your groups, which is hard to do in large groups.

The funny thing is that there was no discernible pattern of forum use according to the lecture topic. The first, and easiest lecture [in one equation: N(t+1) = rN(t)], was discussed a lot. After that, it was mostly random noise. Another interesting phenomenon is that most of the discussions focused on reproducing examples from the course, *i.e.* working out the mathematics, and calculations. It was kind of unexpected, but I think there is a simple reason behind this: maths are hostile, and especially to biologists. There is also a strong local contingency on this particular point - a good proportion of the students have only high-school level mathematics (although I think it is more than enough for an undegrad level course in population biology). What I think happened is that students focused on the math, and invested less time in the mechanisms they represent. It's arguably the hardest thing to get (that an equation represents an idealized ecological reality, and that the form of the equation is an hypothesis on the mechanisms), and students got better at it near the end of the term. I don't care if you can't work out the equilibrium population density, or get the leading eigenvalue of the Leslie matrix. For one thing, this is not population biology, it won't be on the tests, and you certainly won't do it by hand in real life (I almost never do it, I have *Mathematica* for this). I ended my intro to the class with this comic from [*Abstruse Goose*](http://abstrusegoose.com):

I'm glad to see that students did fight with the metaphorical dragon. I'll be sure to spend more time explaining that you should stop the fight once your understanding of maths is "good enough" to start thinking about biology.

But to get back to the topic of using forums, here's the list of pros and cons I ended up with.

#Pros
- The students interact with themselves, so it can lead to a good group dynamic
- You can keep an eye on the discussions, and get a feeling about how well the material is understood
- The material is available to all, and the students can read through it at any time

#Cons
- It's difficult to have the students participate
- The choice of the platform is important - this can explain the previous point

So here it is. I anticipate to use something similar again in the future, because the pros (mostly the fact that all students have the same information, and can help one another) outweighs the cons. The students were not too enthusiastic about it, for different reasons. One of which is that it's not the way other lecturers and professors do it, so it felt outside their comfort zone. But those who participated in it, got something out of the exercise, and I still think it can be a good support tool for a course (though, perhaps, not the only one).
