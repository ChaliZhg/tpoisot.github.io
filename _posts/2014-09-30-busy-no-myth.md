I have seen a few blog posts recently about *the myth of busy* in PhD students
and other academics. In short, it seems that everyone is incredibly busy,
all the time, and that how much time you *don't* have is a proxy of your
academic credentials. I disagree.

Not with the premise -- we are busy. All of us. We have plenty of things
to do, and plenty of pressure to do them fast, so that we can do some more
things fast and show our leadership and competitiveness and all of these
things that look good on your grant applications. That, I agree with.

What I disagree with is that being busy is a choice. I was struck by how
incredibly condescending it was to tell graduate students *make the choice to
stop being so busy*. But on the other hand, I understand some of the reasons.

When I started my masters, I was amused by undergraduates running around
being overworked; they were, after all, far less busy than I was. When I was
a PhD candidate, I always thought that masters students where complaining
too much about how much they had to do. At some points during my post-doc,
I was kindly looking back to my PhD years -- how less busy I would be if I
was expected to produce three papers in four years! Last year, I was talking
to a far more senior colleague, and told him that I have been keeping busy
lately; he told me *Tim, you have no idea what busy feels like*.

But taking a step back, no one seems particularly more overworked. First
years BSc students seems to chasing after deadlines as often and with as
much despair as I do. So I wanted to come up with an explanation. Here it
is: the raw volume of things we have to do increases over time; so does our
productivity, but with a delay. We are essentially in a Red-Queen dynamics
with ourselves: more work to do means that we have to develop a new coping
strategy, in the form of more productive habits. Then when we feel comfortable,
we take on more work, and become overworked again.

Busy is no myth, busy is a statistical effect. It's the difference between our
workload and our productivity, and we implement time-saving measures *because*
we need them *because* we have too much work to do at the moment. If you
have very little to do, but waste a lot of time, you are as busy as someone
doing a lot but with a good productivity.

And asking of graduate students to stop looking so damn busy is futile;
what we need is share out time-effectiveness habits, early. If they seem
like overkill, good! It means that they are buying us some time. I wish good
working habits have been touched upon *more* during my training. And unless
we agree to do it, and show students how to organise, we have no right to
dismiss their business as a myth.
