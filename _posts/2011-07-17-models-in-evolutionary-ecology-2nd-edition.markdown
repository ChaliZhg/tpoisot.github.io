The videos of the talks given during the second edition of the [Models in
Evolutionary Ecology](http://www.seminar-mee.org/home/programme) seminar,
which I co-organized, are currently being put on-line. [You can see them on
Dailymotion](http://www.dailymotion.com/playlist/x1mv7l_mez_en_video_cefe-
colloque) (my own talk is not online yet). This seminar was organized by
french PhD Students, in order to foster interactions between people working on
experimental and theoretical aspects of the multiple fields that make
evolutionary ecology.

This year was our second attempt at organizing a seminar. For the first time,
we opened registration to doctoral students and post-docs outside from france,
and we are happy to have hosted talk by foreign researchers.

Feel free to see and share the videos!
