Over the last year, I have had *a lot* of discussions about upsides,
downsides, and other directionless-sides (assuming there are such things)
of open science. I talked about the upsides many times (and I will keep on
doing it), but it would not be really honest not to mention the potential
disadvantages and risks of adopting new practices: publishing in new journals,
using preprints in a field where it is not the norm, open peer-review,
publishing raw datasets, ... So, roll yourself in your favorite blanket,
and brace yourself for the impending wave of negativity (also a *Jurassic
Park* quote somewhere to keep you on the edge).

Most of the risks come from the fact that these practices are, to a certain
extent, *new* [^new], and science is historically well attached to its
"rules and standards" [@kuh70, chap. 2]:

> Because [the new scientist] there joins men who learned the bases of
their field from the same concrete models, his subsequent practice will
seldom evoke overt disagreement over fundamentals. **Men whose research is
based on shared paradigms are committed to the same rules and standards
for scientific practice**. That commitment and the apparent consensus it
produces are prerequisites for normal science, *i.e.*, for the genesis and
continuation of a particular research tradition.

Keeping the same core of (currently) common practices, in this perspective,
is a matter of self-preservation (and it is amusing to note that in Kuhn's
view, at least as it is expressed in this paragraph, there is little
chance that *established* scientists will be the source of change -- my own
observations don't support that, but this is 45 years after this paragraph
was written). Deviation from these practices carries a two-fold risk of
either excluding yourself from the boy's club (I'm most likely reading too
much into it, but I always found Kuhn's use of *men* instead of *scientists*
meaningful), or being viewed as opposed to the "continuation" of your field.

Falling exactly in line with this argument, most of the objections to open
science that I have received, were about the need to preserve either oneself
or the field as a whole. Preprints are bad because they will facilitate
the spread of (and legitimate) bad or biased science. Open reviews are bad
because people will hold grudges against you. Publishing in new journals is
bad because -- whether we like it or not -- the journals you publish in are
still used as a measure of your worth, and the name of a journal is most
likely a "green-beard trait".

All of these potential costs are real (although I think that the benefits,
both collective and individuals, far outweigh them), and so it should be
expected that open science would hurt early-career scientists the most. This
attitude is exemplified by the recent decision of *Ecology Letters* not
to allow preprinted papers to be submitted [so as to protect early career
people from themselves][ele] (although they should be given credit for at
least discussing the situation). Yet as far as I can tell, the opposite is
happening: those of us with supposedly the most to lose are also spending
the most time and energy experimenting, advocating, and generally having
tons of fun trying to make ourselves at home.

And this is a side of the discussion that is (I think) often overlooked. It's
about settling into a new home, and shuffling the furniture around a bit
to see if we can make it more to our liking. It's not about tearing down
the house to build a hippie commune. And it's certainly not about shifting
the system towards practices that would allow us to be sloppy and generally
unprofessional. Most of the calls for openness in science are emphasizing
accountability and transparency; I really am convinced that in an entirely
open system, it is virtually impossible to cut corners (tho in the immortal
words of Dr. Ian Malcolm, "Life finds a way"). In short, deciding whether or
not it's worth bearing whatever (real of perceived) costs of open science
is worth it is about deciding whether or not we trust that the system is
currently at its global optimum, and whether or not less seasoned scientists
also have a saying in shaping the system they will practice their science in.

Marie Curie is quoted as saying "Nothing in life is to be feared, it is
only to be understood; now is the time to understand more, so that we may
fear less.". This captures my feelings about all of the above particularly
well. I think it's important not to overlook the fact that some of the people
the most able to bear the "costs" of these practices are also (sometimes)
opposed to them for fear of said costs. But without seriously considering these
practices, that is by not seeing them as marginal anymore, it's difficult
to say whether or not these costs exist at all, and whether they will erode
over time because we will also better understand and measure the benefits.

I would hate that you think that I am reducing the issue to a generation-gap
thing, which I don't believe it is. But it's true that those of us with less
reputation attached to our name should be the most fearful of any new practice
that would supposedly attract any cost, because it would hit us proportionally
harder than it would hit someone with a number of publications in the triple
digits. Nor am I expecting that everything will change overnight. But without
being really engaged in some experimentation, I don't think we will ever be
able to correctly assess the costs and the benefits.

As a final note -- I could write a text twice as long about all of the good
things that happened to me as a consequence of being open. I've heard the
argument that some of the costs may be expressed years after the fact. I really
don't think this is a particularity of either the new or old ways of doing
things. And I understand that all of us have different experiences. But from
what I have heard of people trying new things, the result was "mostly good".

[^new]: I don't really think that any of these practices are inherently
new. They are certainly variations around the way things are done currently,
but they appeared through mutation rather than being invasions.
