I'm glad to announce that we (I, [Ross Mounce](http://rossmounce.co.uk/aboutme/), and Dom Gravel), have put up a [preprint about data sharing in ecology](http://figshare.com/articles/Moving_toward_a_sustainable_ecological_science_don_t_let_data_go_to_waste_/693745) on *fig**share***. The manuscript is under consideration at *Ideas in Ecology & Evolution*. We try to make a valid point about why ecologists should share their data, how we can do it in practice, and the role that funding agencies and journals can play.

And speaking of preprints, but also sure to check out Philippe's opinion piece on [preprints in biology](http://figshare.com/articles/The_case_for_open_preprints_in_biology/655710), which should appear shortly in *PLoS Biology*. We try to understand why biologists have not adopted the preprint culture as widely as other fields (though this is changing, fortunately).
