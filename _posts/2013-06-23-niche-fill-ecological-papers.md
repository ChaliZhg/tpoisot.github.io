title: A niche to fill in ecological publishing?

I have been wondering, over the past few weeks, about places to submit
really short, methodological minded papers, in ecology. As far as I know,
there is currently no journal for that. I'm specifically talking
about papers that are not groundbreaking, possibly extremely
technical, but still hold value because they deal with arguments that
happen often. As a good example, the reply of [Rohr and
colleagues][rohr] to the [James and colleagues][james] paper is interesting, but technical. It's unlikely to stimulate a debate in the whole community, but for the people active on the topic, it's something to read and think of (regardless of who you side with on the issue discussed).

So where to publish this? *[Methods in Ecology and Evolution][mee]* seems to
be *the* ideal place for that, but their guidelines do not offer the
opportunity to submit this kind of papers. *F1000Research* and *PeerJ* are good
places as well, but fairly expensive is you want to do a one-off thing. You
always have the opportunity to publish things in your blog, but unless you are
a big-name blogger, your result will go un-noticed (which is why I'll work on
turning [this entry][netcompl] into a short note somewhere.

*ArXiV* is another possibility, but the readership in biological sciences is
[too low at the moment][preprint]. So there is possibly a niche to fill for an
adventurous journal. Let's give us a place to write short notes, so that the
active debates are *documented*, no matter what the number of people debating
is. What do you think?
