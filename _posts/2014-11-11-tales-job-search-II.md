[Last time][partI], I told the story of my application to French academic
jobs, the really weird process of applying and interviewing, and (ultimately)
the rejection. After taking a few months to think about it, I decided to
apply to more "standard" positions. My main motivation was (still is) that
I wanted more teaching, and more interactions with students, than the French
system usually offers.

There were a few jobs openings at this time, and I went through the process
of putting together a research and teaching statement, updating my resume,
and all that. Over a period of a few months, I ended up with a quite nice
package to send around. Papers were coming out, too, so I figured that my
first interview was going to happen soon enough (I was wrong). I was not in
any particular hurry to get a job (I just signed up for a post-doc with two
years of funding), so I carefully selected where I would like to apply.

I sent two applications. I got two negative replies. This chapter or my job
search was a whole year of nothing much happening (by choice), and a few
weeks of wondering when I would have a decision, followed by a rejection
letter. It was boring, and anti-climactic to an extreme.

Then some time in spring (or whatever passes for spring in Qu√©bec),
my wife and I discovered that we were soon going to be parents. Both of
us are biologists, so we were well aware that this event was well within
the expected confidence interval. But still we had to deal with all of the
practical details. One of the most pressing being that I kicked myself in
the metaphorical nuts, and decided to get a position.

I would have been happy to keep on applying to position periodically for a
year or two -- life as a post-doc is pretty sweet when you are not running
after funding -- but having to take care of baby required a little bit
more certainties about where we will be in the medium term. And when I was
attending a conference in Montreal in August, I heard about an opening in
numerical ecology. That seemed like a dream job (still does!), so I decided
to apply. That will be the story of part 3...
