A few weeks ago, I discovered Jekyll. In a nutshell, Jekyll is a static site generator who promised me I'll be able to [blog like a hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html). This site is now hosted on GitHub, and both the [template and the content can be forked](https://github.com/tpoisot/tpoisot.github.com), so everything is basically open source.
