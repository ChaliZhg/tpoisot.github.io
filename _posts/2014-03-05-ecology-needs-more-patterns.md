title: Ecologists needs to focus more on patterns

Ecology is the study, which is to say the identification, description, and
reporting, of patterns. Patterns are simply defined as there being something
rather than nothing, which is to say something that can represented as a
histogram or a scatterplot, or even just called a pattern because this helps
relate it to previously described patterns.

Sub-fields of ecology are primarily defined by which types of
patterns they look for. Functional ecologists are interested in traits
distribution patterns. Macroecologists look for species distribution
patterns. Biogeographers do that too, but they focus on slightly
different patterns of species distributions. Food web ecologists looks for
network structure patterns. Community ecologists are interested in niche
differentiation patterns. Some ecologists, allegedly, are into the study of
mechanism; this is not as un-orthodox as it seems, for what are mechanisms,
if not processes giving rise to patterns? Their study is therefore, if not
entirely excusable, understandable as an interesting intellectual passtime
for those unlucky enough not to have access to big databases.

But I digress. There is an issue we should collectively adress, and it relates
to the search for meta-patterns. For example, several species distribution
patterns are similar, and so we ought to recognize this observation for what
it is: there is a pattern of species distribution patterns. The same holds for
other types of patterns. The next breakthrough in ecology will probably come
from the identification of these meta-patterns. My personnal opinion is that
this breakthrough has been delayed because so many things that are patterns
are called something else, thus preventing unification of the vocabulary.

I would even say that our remarkable self-restraint in using the p-word
is bringing much technical confusion to the litterature. Although this is
surely of interest to statisticians, most of us should not be too concerned
by whether the reported pattern is a *distribution*, a *relationship*, or
something else entirely. We would greatly simplify our writing by calling
all of these by their proper denomination: *significant patterns*.

This would, as I proposed above, bring conceptual unification to ecology
by allowing us to gloss over the tedious mathematical details. For example,
the search for patterns of species distributions patterns now becomes the much
more ecologier search for significant patterns of significant species patterns
patterns. And of course, as it is timely to dismiss the use of *p*-values as
an old tradition slowly going away, "significant" is always assumed because
we are obviously above doing unsignificant research. No longer will one feel
excluded because the precise nuance of each term is sometimes difficult to
grasp. To some extent, we are about to prove Lawton wrong. Community ecology
is not a mess. We made it a mess by refusing to recognize that everything
is a pattern, and much like in the Tower of Babel analogy, we made our field
tumble and fall because we used a meaningless variety of highly specific terms.

But conceptual unification of the field through the elimination of superfluous
words (words such as, for instance, superfluous) serves a very limited purpose
if it won't allow to create bridges with other fields. Evolutionary ecology,
because it studies the rise of patterns through evolution, can be re-branded
as the study of the emergence of complex patterns. It is admitted that all
patterns are complex, as if they were not, being smart people with diplomas,
we would have found about them already.

So there it is; ecology is built upon patterns, and in the future, it should
be patterns all the way down. The divide between theoreticians and empiricists
can, at this point, only be bridged by having a common language, in which
anything worth mentionning is refered to as a pattern. Some would call this
language poorer. They would be wrong. Pauperisation is when each word only
holds a small amount of meaning; this drives the division of ecology in
obscure sub-fields unable to communicate. By refocusing our research efforts
on patterns, and patterns of patterns, we will be able to re-unify our field.

**A final (and serious) note**

In case this was not obvious by the overall absurdity, and the picture
of an eminently Rococo *Satyr* (get it?), this is meant to be a satirical
piece. In case you wonder, yes, it felt good to write it, I got rid of so much
frustration. Now for the serious part. I have a feeling that the p-word is
used to mean a *lot* of things. I played a game at a meeting the other day:
some of the speakers clocked in at over 1.5 ppm, which is to say "patterns
per minute". It would have been the most dangerous drinking game. Removing
stop-words, *i.e.* extremely frequent words regardless of the topic discussed,
I'm sure *pattern* was **the** most frequently used term.

From my own observations, *pattern* is used to mean either *distribution*
(in the statistical sense), *relationship* (often statistical, sometimes
mechanistic), and other times either to describe something that we can't
quite qualify. In some cases, *patterns* is superfluous (also, I don't think
we should get rid of superfluous), and can be removed entirely without loss
of meaning - I would argue that *species distribution pattern* is a perfect
example of the later. Actually, there is at least one valid sentence in
my first paragraph: *pattern* means something, rather than nothing; but it
fails to provide any information about the *nature* of this thing.

Mark Twain said that young writers should write *damn* every time they would
have written *very*; the editor would then remove *damn*, and the text will
not be diminished. For a few months, I had a macro replacing *pattern* by
*stuff*, which I think is equally informative. As a result, I stopped using
*pattern* (almost) entirely, and I think it improved my writing. Notably,
it forced me to pick the right word, instead of letting the reader figure
out what I meant as an exercise.
