I am currently going through the Instructor Training for [Software
Carpentry]. It is a really rich and transformative experience, and besides
the software side of things, full of useful elements for teaching in any
context. As we are currently discussing how motivation affects learning, our
weekly assignment is to write the story of our biggest de-motivation, how
it affected us, and what happened (and should have happened) next. Here's
mine. Very few people know it, even fewer know the name of all parties
involved.

# The story

I was finishing my BSc in biology (with a strong bias towards cellular
biology and physiology), and I had decided a few months ago that I wanted
to switch fields a bit, to do more ecology and evolution. I applied for
one particular program somewhere in France, that had all of the elements I
wanted: broad overview of the field, good reputation, possibility to pick
from a lot of classes.

I made the pre-selection, and somewhere in July, I called the university to
have the final decision. It was no, without more details. To have an idea
of what was wrong, I called the head of the program, and asked him. I head
him shuffle through a few papers, and then he told me

> Well, let's not fool yourself. With your academic record, the best you
could hope for is to end up as a technician in some lab. You'll never be a
researcher, and we don't have time to waste nurturing your delusions. Goodbye.

He hang up. This is an almost verbatim transcription, because trust me, the
memory is still with me these days. These were the single most important,
transformative, defining 12 seconds of my academic life.

# How I reacted

I decided to quit academia, and become a technician in a lab. Private sector,
because I had a few contacts, and mostly because if working at a university
means risking working with someone like him, then there was no chance I
would work at a university.

# What should have been done

Nothing? Nothing. He was (he still is) a full professor in a big lab, with
a good reputation, and *prestige*. I was (I'm not anymore) an undergraduate
student. These things just happen, and (from the few observations I've had),
even when they happen, things turn out well for the people with the most
established reputation. This is the logic by which a PhD advisor can tell
his student

> I don't care about your financial issues, you should work harder to be as
productive as I tell you to be.

When the student talks the situation out with another professor, he hears

> Well, try to see things from his perspective, he cares about the reputation
of his group; are you sure you really can't work harder?

This is the logic by which an advisor can take his foreign PhD student's
results, give them to its postdoc to publish without acknowledging the
student contribution, then "forgot" to write the letter so that the student
can renew his visa, and has to go back to its home country without being able
to either stand his case or even defend his thesis. Which was summarized by
the advisor in question as

> an unfortunate series of mishaps and misunderstandings

The advisor is still working, the student defended and quit research.

These things happened; I singled them out not because they are particularly
ugly (they are), but because I knew these situations well enough to understand
the dynamics that caused them.

These things just happen, and will keep on happening as long as people
encourage students to go with advisors that have *a good reputation, but a
few quirks, you should not pay too much attention to them because his name
will help you in the long run*. These things will keep on happening as long
as some people think that being something else than a professor is shameful,
or is for people of lower intellectual status than they are. This thing will
keep on happening as long as some have the idea that first-author publications
and academic prestige by proxy give you a blank check for any behavior. These
things will probably keep on happening forever.

There is nothing to be done in these situations, because they happen when
people have understood so well that they are in a position of consequence-free
power, that they can behave however they please. These situations happen
when people with power, reputation, or prestige, see people without any of
these attributes as expendables, and don't feel particularly pressured to
care for their needs, aspirations, or well-being. Whenever a system allows
(and rewards, or at least fails to punish, which is equally bad) people
to us *people* as tools for their own motives, then these situations will
arise. There is nothing motivational, no pedagogic objective behind them. They
are the ugly manifestation of a system in which you won't face any punishment
for being exploitative, demeaning, or disrespectful, as long as you're on top.

# What has been done in practice

One lecturer from my BSc emailed me asking for news a month or so later, and
which MSc program I would be in next year. I told her none, and explained why.

Then she emailed me back. And like that, I saw the worse, and the best of
the academic world. I saw the type of person I wanted to be, and the type of
person I want everyone to avoid. She told me *Here's my office number. Call
me. Now.*. I did.

We had a long conversation. And it's funny, in a very sad way, that I
barely remember any details of this conversation. I remember a feeling of
being overwhelmed with so many strong and conflicting emotions, but none of
the details. But I remember the message. She told me that she had no idea
whether I would end up doing research, but she's observed me enough to know
that I have the drive and the curiosity to at least try. She told me that
she didn't believe there was anyone that did not deserve a chance to try,
but even if there were, that would not be me. She told me she forwarded my
academic transcript to another masters program, that I have invested time
and energy in my training, that she and her colleagues did too, and that I
owed it to myself, and to them, to give it a shot. She told me that I had
to day to get my ass into the admission office, and sign my enrollment form
before she dragged me there herself.

She gave me a chance. I took it. That was seven years ago, and I've done
some research since. Some of it might even be good, and (it's the part I
like the most about this story), guess who cited some of it? I'm sure he
doesn't remember the story. I don't care. I do remember it. I'll make my
best not to forget it. I'll make my best to be the one who gives chances
and believes in people, because that's why I'm still here.
